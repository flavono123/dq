abomination:
  abomination+str_afflicted_abusive_0: Bung it up again and I'll awaken it!
  abomination+str_afflicted_abusive_1: You vex me worse than my mortal affliction!
  abomination+str_afflicted_abusive_2: You look like rejects from an opium den's lavatory
    bucket.
  abomination+str_afflicted_abusive_3: All I see around me is dangerous incompetence.
  abomination+str_afflicted_abusive_4: What a cruel twist of fate to be stuck with
    you mummers.
  abomination+str_afflicted_depressed_0: I fear it is inevitable that it will consumes
    me from within.
  abomination+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Was this all worth it? For knowledge... for
    gold.
  abomination+str_afflicted_depressed_2: This burden dims my very soul.
  abomination+str_afflicted_depressed_3: It feeds off of my essence, even now I falter...
  abomination+str_afflicted_depressed_4: The hours tumble by, dull and empty since
    that terrible day.
  abomination+str_afflicted_fearful_0: FLEE! FLEE WHILE YOU CAN!
  abomination+str_afflicted_fearful_1: What are we still doing here?! We must leave
    or PERISH!
  abomination+str_afflicted_fearful_2: Do you not see how our fate is sealed? HOW
    THE DIE IS CAST?!
  abomination+str_afflicted_fearful_3: My will's iron is bent and my blood is like
    icewater.
  abomination+str_afflicted_fearful_4: There is no midnight as black as this vision.
  abomination+str_afflicted_fearful_5: This is a trap!
  abomination+str_afflicted_irrational_0: But what you don't comprehend is the tremendous
    size of our cage!
  abomination+str_afflicted_irrational_1: It tells me I can only feed on river mud.
  abomination+str_afflicted_irrational_2: The rumours are true! I am the true king
    of this land!
  abomination+str_afflicted_irrational_3: Please silence your destriers, good sirs!
  abomination+str_afflicted_irrational_4: I have heard whispers that the woman over
    the sea have green hair.
  abomination+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Now I will know the dark delight of bloodletting,
    as it does!
  abomination+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: Each scar is a blissful lesson to be meditated
    upon.
  abomination+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Blood will transmute me! Transmute us all!
  abomination+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Perhaps this violence will soothe it, keep
    it sleeping...
  abomination+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Finally the pain promised by what whispers
    dark inside me!
  abomination+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Of course, why didn't I see it sooner!? Betrayers
    all of you!
  abomination+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: You would abandon me alone here, would you
    not?
  abomination+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Out of respect, wait until I am fully dead
    before picking me over like vultures.
  abomination+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: I trust you less than the common vagrants
    who patrol my city.
  abomination+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: I have oft wondered if evil is drawn to my
    better half.
  abomination+str_afflicted_selfish_0: I claim this victory for the brothel!
  abomination+str_afflicted_selfish_1: I am literally twice the threat of any of you.
  abomination+str_afflicted_selfish_2: None of you exhibit the discipline needed.
  abomination+str_afflicted_selfish_3: Don't be surprised to find me gone on the morrow.
  abomination+str_afflicted_selfish_4: 'Just remember: the more gold I get, the less
    of IT you''ll see.'
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: A solid clout for a bothersome lout!
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: If you won't heed my words then heed
    this!
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_abusive_2: A fitting reward for your stupid behaviour!
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: Perhaps we could meet behind the tavern
    later?
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: Did you wish to borrow my chain?
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_irrational_2: This is a game I read about in the
    eastern histories.
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Consider this a warning from my better
    half!
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Did you think I would wait for you to
    act against us?
  abomination+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_2: A little blood should warn off the rest
    of you vultures!
  abomination+str_attack_self_depressed_0: If another can finish this...
  abomination+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Can one feel pain in a nightmare?
  abomination+str_attack_self_depressed_2: Death is the key to this cage.
  abomination+str_attack_self_irrational_0: Which of you wanted wine?
  abomination+str_attack_self_irrational_1: It is time I pulled myself inside out!
  abomination+str_attack_self_irrational_2: There! I am absolved! The moon can return!
  abomination+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: It's never quite as satisfying as when
    inflicted by another.
  abomination+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Observe, fiends. This where it hurts
    the best.
  abomination+str_attack_self_masochistic_2: Please tell me you can do worse than
    this!
  abomination+str_back_stress_masochistic_0: Death could hardly be sweeter than this
    agony!
  abomination+str_back_stress_masochistic_1: The more I bleed, the less I feel it,
    sadly.
  abomination+str_back_stress_masochistic_2: Pain was the true key to my cell door.
  abomination+str_bark_encourage_0: We can withstand anything if I can just hold this
    fiend back!
  abomination+str_bark_encourage_1: Forward! We have nothing to lose, for all expires
    too soon!
  abomination+str_bark_encourage_2: Unity is the catalyst for victory!
  abomination+str_bark_first_aid_0: I know just enough to be dangerous, now be still.
  abomination+str_bark_first_aid_1: These bruises are inconsequential.
  abomination+str_bark_first_aid_2: Thank my torturer who was tasked with keeping
    me alive.
  abomination+str_bark_hobby_0: I only ever had time for my crucible and scrolls.
  abomination+str_bark_hobby_1: Oh I've loved before, but all were forgotten in the
    laboratory.
  abomination+str_bark_hobby_2: Care to see my drawings for a mechanical hand?
  abomination+str_bark_pep_talk_0: Will is stronger than hope. Believe me.
  abomination+str_bark_pep_talk_1: I can sense the strength within you.
  abomination+str_bark_pep_talk_2: Find your core, hold fast to your convictions!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: Thugs! I doubt any of you can even read letters!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: What tomfoolery are you on about then?!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Pfah!  I spit at your mental indiscipline!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: I sleep now praying it awakens and rends
    you louts to ribbons.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Snoring has been known to awaken the
    beast.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Are you incompetent in your dreams as
    well?
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: Asleep or awake, the nightmare is
    without end.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Next time I may not regain my humanity...
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: It whispers constantly and I dread
    the moment of understanding.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: Imagine me, half-demon, terrified of
    those creeping shadows.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Surrounded by horrors , inside and out...
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: Was that faint gibbering a phantasm
    of my subverted mind?
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: This bedroll will make a fine cape!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: What sweet fortune to bed down in
    flowers!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: The fire will sleep with me! it is
    decided!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Pass me the salt, my wounds have
    dulled.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: A rested mind perceives a sharper
    agony.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Ah to awaken and tear off fresh
    scabs.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: One wrong move, one word misplaced
    and your flesh is ours.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: It has been known to defend me in my
    sleep.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: You traitors conspire against a force
    you cannot comprehend.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Give me that! I eat for two.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Keep silent, I must focus to soothe
    the other.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: How can it be my fault? I have no control
    over it!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: I fear my demon makes me immortal, dooming
    me forever.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: No heavier chains than those of doubt and
    misgiving.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: I feel I am trapped inside of it, an eternal
    nightmare.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Out of the frying pan, into the fire!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: If I fall here, at least I die a free man...
  abomination+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: This is certainly doom that I feel. Our doom.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: I wrote tomes far in the past to trap
    my future self, now!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Mother! Mother! Are we off to the monastary?
  abomination+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Graaawwoowrrrr!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: I wonder my taint has spread to another
    here.
  abomination+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: That dirge... one of you is in league with
    the elder things!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: Strike my back and you will find you have
    stabbed an angry demon!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Twice the manpower, twice the pay!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: I would be better to simply forsake you all
    here!
  abomination+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: This all reminds me of how I am destined
    for greater things!
  abomination+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Alchemy created this divide inside me, and
    naught else will work.
  abomination+str_block_buff_depressed_1: Too risky, I teeter on the threshold and
    it lurks beyond!
  abomination+str_block_buff_depressed_2: It fear it stirs inside me, back away!
  abomination+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Diamond tail is raven, fan tail is crow.
  abomination+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Never trust a calf that screams like a
    woman.
  abomination+str_block_buff_irrational_2: I am preoccupied with measuring those distant
    orbs.
  abomination+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: The greatest alchemy is borne in sweet
    agony.
  abomination+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: Pain is what I owe for freedom.
  abomination+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Hah, even the wheel couldn't break me!
  abomination+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: That looks intended to weaken not invigorate.
  abomination+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: No! That might awaken it!
  abomination+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: I have read of such soul traps in forbidden
    scrolls.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I am full... are any children missing
    from the hamlet?
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Perhaps starvation is the key to
    purging this taint.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_2: When I am hungry it is easier to
    fight it.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Blue is a fine meal, but yellow
    is what I truly need.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: I only eat gold since speaking
    with the saints.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_2: 'Troublesome news: the furniture
    has marched off in protest.'
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: Starvation is a fine pain to savour
    slowly.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Food would distract from the slow
    burn of my wounds.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_2: Is that lye? No thank you.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: Eventually it will devour one of
    you traitors.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: I'd rather starve than die painfully
    from your clumsy toxins.
  abomination+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_2: I am fine with what I packed for
    myself.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: I should probably save
    my time for one worthy of it.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: I have no patience for
    the ignorant.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Do you think there's actually
    a cure for stupidity?
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: Better you stay well
    back, it stirs...
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: I would but I am not
    fully in control...
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Be silent, I am willing
    it to be still!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: My hands shake too much!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: They are too near!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: Fear has slain my rational
    qualities!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: My apologies but the
    King is not accepting further petitions.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: How can you perceive
    me in this etheric mode?
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: You never visited me
    in my cell, as you promised!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Do not interrupt agony's
    sweet song!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Too busy re-salting
    my wounds!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Only if you'll flog
    me.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: I will not drop my guard,
    not even for you.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Is this a trick then?
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: A weak ruse, I should
    kill you
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: Make it worth my time first.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: I'd rather save my strength
    for the next battle.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: Amusing proposition, but
    no.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Help from a fool is twice
    the trouble.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: I am not entire convinced
    of your ability.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_2: You don't actually know what
    you are doing, do you?
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Soon my fate will be upon
    me, and you.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: I can't decide if it would
    help the beast or hinder it.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_2: An insignificant drop in
    the bucket.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: No fish to sell today!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: A great red comet haunts
    my dreams...
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_2: I have heard tales that
    we live on a great egg.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Oh no, I love this feeling!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: I found myself through
    torture and the blessed pain.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: What a clever poison, perhaps
    I can kill you with it later.
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: KEEP AWAY! You threaten to
    awaken it!
  abomination+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_2: Wouldn't it be easier to
    kill me in my sleep?
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: Don't you see? If I die, WE die!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: I have no shelter to regain. No
    solace exists for me.
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_2: There is no peace so long as I
    am cursed.
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: That vessel is not suitable for
    the ethers!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: I have been promised a trip on
    dragon back!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_2: You fool! We have already fled!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: This is my kind of bloodbath!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: This slaughter suits us both!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_2: And what? Return to the dull
    hamlet?
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: A cunning ploy, yet transparent!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: This position keeps my enemies
    in plain sight!
  abomination+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_2: I would not just simply walk into
    your clumsy ambush!
  abomination+str_block_heal_depressed_0: Heal me, you heal the beast.
  abomination+str_block_heal_depressed_1: Best to keep my dark half weakened. It will
    return soon...
  abomination+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Do you think that will help? I am mortally
    cursed!
  abomination+str_block_heal_irrational_0: Only if you'll listen to my latest epic.
  abomination+str_block_heal_irrational_1: That morning it rained nails and rotten
    wheat.
  abomination+str_block_heal_irrational_2: I passed the howling woman again, is she
    drowning?
  abomination+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: The pain helps steel me against its will.
  abomination+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: I will pull the stitches, then you may
    sew me again.
  abomination+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: I am nowhere near the bright agonies I
    crave.
  abomination+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: How did you know I needed that?
  abomination+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: It reeks of conspiracy, coward.
  abomination+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: I am not the easy victual you take me for.
  abomination+str_block_item_depressed_0: Sooner than later it will possess me completely.
  abomination+str_block_item_depressed_1: You shouldn't bother with the damned.
  abomination+str_block_item_depressed_2: Is it not obvious I haven't much longer
    as myself?
  abomination+str_block_item_irrational_0: No, no, I have no coins on me and the missus
    is nowhere to be found.
  abomination+str_block_item_irrational_1: Not a fair trade, this donkey is made of
    pure eastern silk.
  abomination+str_block_item_irrational_2: Pointless, I already have seven of those.
  abomination+str_block_item_masochistic_0: What logic is there in soothing wounds?
  abomination+str_block_item_masochistic_1: That stitching needle looks too thin.
  abomination+str_block_item_paranoid_0: You aim to awaken it!
  abomination+str_block_item_paranoid_1: No, I get a bad feeling when you're near.
  abomination+str_block_item_paranoid_2: Where did you come from? You weren't here
    just a moment ago.
  abomination+str_block_move_abusive_0: Your orders have always been tainted with
    incompetence!
  abomination+str_block_move_abusive_1: Strategy? More like a herd of cats!
  abomination+str_block_move_abusive_2: Your will is incomprehensible and irrational.
  abomination+str_block_move_fearful_0: No, not on your life!
  abomination+str_block_move_fearful_1: Ice-cold terror grips my will!
  abomination+str_block_move_fearful_2: There is no shelter to be found!
  abomination+str_block_move_irrational_0: The orders were for me to stay here.
  abomination+str_block_move_irrational_1: A flower with legs? Foolish notion.
  abomination+str_block_move_irrational_2: Such dreams of a flaming sword and streams
    of molten nickel.
  abomination+str_block_move_masochistic_0: This is where they like to swing!
  abomination+str_block_move_masochistic_1: Too busy licking my own wounds.
  abomination+str_block_move_masochistic_2: Do not disturb this sweet agony!
  abomination+str_block_move_paranoid_0: I would rather wait and keep watch of the
    shadows.
  abomination+str_block_move_paranoid_1: I would stay, your orders are cast in doubt.
  abomination+str_block_move_paranoid_2: Hold fast! They could be anywhere!
  abomination+str_buff_party_powerful_0: We end this now!
  abomination+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Fate conspires for us, surprisingly!
  abomination+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: It stirs within! They must be
    afraid!
  abomination+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Strike the nerve I showed you,
    the art is ancient but lethal.
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: Better that someone strong face these
    monsters.
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: My blows are useless.
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Here. Best to die right here.
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: I may be doomed but I will escape if
    I can!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Something in the shadows! THERE!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: My legs betray me!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_irrational_0: Never stand beneath Algol, it is the
    star that spawns nightmares!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_irrational_1: Too quick for you!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_irrational_2: ".nrut fo tuo kaeps reveN"
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: They are sent by the order to reclaim
    me!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: It is me they want! No!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: My curse is like honey to the flies
    of evil!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Our tactics are all wrong! Any idiot
    can see that!
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I am far more efficient acting from here.
  abomination+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: I was here first!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: I must die so that I can take this thing
    back to hell!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Let the impure be sacrificed for those
    more worthy.
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: I am a threat to the innocent. Darkness
    claim me.
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Out of my way, I would have the last
    hen!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: I will not suffer the spray of the
    sea on my new cloak!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Haha, join us in this fun! Hahaha!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Perhaps now we can both die!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Anyone with this burden would pursue
    death!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Each drop of blood is treasured, sacred!
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Those eyes will make excellent reagents.
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Finished making a fool of yourself?
  abomination+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: I am doing you a favour, trust me.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Yes, aren't you just the slayer
    of beast and demon?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: I thought that one looked sickly.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_2: It appears to have tripped onto
    on your weapon.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Uhm hum! Proper!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: There is a curious odour that
    escapes me.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_2: Where is poetry in this wound?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: I was just going to do that!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Attacking out of turn again?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_2: I had distracted it for MY attack!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: How you pretended to be mighty!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Untrained and dangerous to
    us all!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: That's it, stir the hornet's
    nest - fool!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Why do you tempt fate, all
    of our fates, with this offense?!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_2: I am ready to flee, just give
    the signal.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: A rainbow blesses your
    weapon!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: What sweet music you make!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: What mimery to miss so!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: Are you the only one in league
    with them...?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: If it survives to wound me,
    I shall return your favour.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: I cannot fight them all myself!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: Going to bleed profusely on them, then?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: We will never hear the end of this.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_2: I am sure that arm was vestigial.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Keep yourself alive! If you fall...
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Don't just throw your life away! We
    need each other!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_2: Keep steady, damn you, I will not face
    them alone!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: We are the very world! It is us!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: It was a strange mirror revealing
    the beings that cling to our ethers.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_2: Snow? Seems early in the year. What
    say you?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: That was delicious.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Positively invigorating. All that
    blood...
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_2: Can I be next? Please?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: I see it! Conspiracy unfolding!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: The long arm of shadow moves its pawn
    against me!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_2: Hah! Proof! You have thrown in with
    them as well!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: My heart is going to burst!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: One more blow and we are done for!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_2: Let us flee while they are off-balance!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Iceberg? What's an iceberg?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Those damnable flutes again...
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_2: Someone needs more time in the
    practice yard.
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: Did you catch the signal?
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: Your schemes to slay me are plain
    as day!
  abomination+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_2: Even the fiends conspire with you,
    yellow craven!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: Don't you see how s-strong I am?!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: Anything to satiate these fiends!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_2: What else can I do? WHAT ELSE?!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: The hawk did it! Look and see where
    it went to!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: I am formally lodging a complaint
    with the Minister!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_2: Ah! Found it!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: There are no tomes that describe
    the ecstacy I have just experienced.
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: The relief of pain distracting me
    from its foul will...
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: This is what you all wanted, no?
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: What else can I do?! I am surrounded
    by the treachorous!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_2: I want you to strike now - you traitors!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: If I can do this, then I certainly deserve
    more respect!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Well don't just gawk, get me a bandage
    post-haste!
  abomination+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_2: My contract states I now qualify for
    an additional share!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Suicide is the egress from all of
    this! I must die!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: I must perish so that it doesn't
    consume us all!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_2: I tire of keeping this hellbeast
    from taking over!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: What a strange bird that flew
    by!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: A fairy wind...look for toadstools!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_2: It sounded just like a screaming
    tree!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: A free man never begs for what
    he can take, and I can take it!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Next time make it count!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_2: Oaf, I'm right here!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: This is the first maneuver by the
    conspirators!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: Hah! Come out of the shadows you
    scum!
  abomination+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_2: I suspected it! They have come for
    me!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_0: I will not be bound again!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_1: I have clawed back my freedom from worse than you!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_2: My curse feeds my rage!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_3: I fear no demon for the greatest monster lies inside!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_4: Destruction is all I can give this world!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_5: Feel the wrath of the hopeless!
  abomination+str_critbyhero_6: AHHHHH!
  abomination+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: It seems I can feed from it as it feeds on
    me.
  abomination+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: This is beyond my knowledge, but I do feel
    strengthened!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: No, you don't want me ruining it all
    for us.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: I'm cursed, better I didn't do anything.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: It whispers... I must be still or we'll
    suffer.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: No! One mistake and it is over for me!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: I can feel its cold hand squeezing my
    heart!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: I do not know... I do not know!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Apologies, in the middle of a delicate
    experiment.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Not until someone thaws me!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Deeper than ever, far beyond any star,
    I hear them...
  abomination+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: One of the order's hired minions I reckon!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I have been betrayed once, never again!
  abomination+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: I can always sense the machinations of
    the craven unfolding.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: Perhaps when I feel like it. Maybe.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: At your convenience? I think not.
  abomination+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: My chances are best here, damn the rest
    of you.
  abomination+str_mark_self_depressed_0: This is my only chance for true freedom.
  abomination+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Strike me down, if the beast will permit
    it!
  abomination+str_mark_self_depressed_2: This world would be better off without us!
  abomination+str_mark_self_irrational_0: A field of gold, watered in blood!
  abomination+str_mark_self_irrational_1: A dozen crowns for the one with the limp!
  abomination+str_mark_self_irrational_2: I am present, Brother Nuncio!
  abomination+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Here! Strike me here! I beg you...
  abomination+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Again! Refresh this pain!
  abomination+str_mark_self_masochistic_2: Dig your talons and weapons into my flesh!
  abomination+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: I fear I am merely a figment of its
    unholy imagination!
  abomination+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: For all of my other's sins, I am
    beyond forgiveness!
  abomination+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: My mind's pillars crumble beneath the
    weight of my fate!
  abomination+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Whatever awaits, it cannot
    be worse than what I've endured.
  abomination+str_random_command_abusive_0: Of course you can't fathom why, you're
    all imbeciles!
  abomination+str_random_command_abusive_1: What does it look like I'm doing?
  abomination+str_random_command_abusive_2: I will not be restrained by idiots!
  abomination+str_random_command_depressed_0: I am merely a puppet to what crawls
    insidious through my blood.
  abomination+str_random_command_depressed_1: I am bound to chaos, why not accept
    it?
  abomination+str_random_command_depressed_2: How can I ever be certain my tainted
    will is my own?
  abomination+str_random_command_irrational_0: See! I can catch the snowflakes on
    my tongue!
  abomination+str_random_command_irrational_1: This colour looks amazing on me. I'll
    take it!
  abomination+str_random_command_irrational_2: D'LESH TUN IKAAARRGGHHHH!
  abomination+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Multiply the bloodshed! Especially
    mine!
  abomination+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Anything! Anything for more blood!
  abomination+str_random_command_masochistic_2: Grim fortune make my flesh smile with
    blessed wounds!
  abomination+str_random_command_paranoid_0: Chaos snarls the threads of any plot.
  abomination+str_random_command_paranoid_1: None of your business!
  abomination+str_random_command_paranoid_2: I must act independently for none can
    be trusted!
  abomination+str_random_command_selfish_0: My will reigns here!
  abomination+str_random_command_selfish_1: Maybe you should note what I do.
  abomination+str_random_command_selfish_2: I do what I need to do. You are all done
    for anyway.
  abomination+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: What could you possibly fear? It's
    only death!
  abomination+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: We did not come this far to turn
    craven!
  abomination+str_stress_heal_stalwart_0: This struggle may never end but I will not
    give in now!
  abomination+str_stress_heal_stalwart_1: I have found new fire inside me!
  abomination+str_virtued_courageous_0: As long as we are one, we can prevail!
  abomination+str_virtued_courageous_1: Steel your hearts and victory is ours!
  abomination+str_virtued_focused_0: They are vulnerable! Strike!
  abomination+str_virtued_focused_1: It is obvious where we must hit them!
  abomination+str_virtued_powerful_0: We will crush them!
  abomination+str_virtued_powerful_1: Run them down and slaughter them!
  abomination+str_virtued_stalwart_0: I can master it! We can master our fate!
  abomination+str_virtued_stalwart_1: As long as I am free, I will fight!
  abomination+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Hah! You have not seen anything yet!
  abomination+str_virtued_vigorous_1: This body still stirs, these lungs draw breath!
antiquarian:
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_abusive_0: Illiterate bumpkins - feh!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_abusive_1: If only I could sell your skins, that I might
    profit marginally from having met you.
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_abusive_2: I wish I could truly express the misery you
    all cause me!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_abusive_3: We stand to perish because of you dullards!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_abusive_4: You are the roots of this tree of woe!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_depressed_0: I brought this down upon us all!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_depressed_1: There is nothing that can be done!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_depressed_2: When precious pottery cracks, there is naught
    to be done!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_depressed_3: A lifetime spent chasing relics of the past...and
    now I am their kin.
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_depressed_4: My ambitions crash down around me!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_fearful_0: Drop the gold!  Drop the supplies!  Drop everything...and
    RUN!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_fearful_1: Cursed censer! It exudes his essence and corrupts
    this expedition!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_fearful_2: What a nightmarish fate - to be lost and forgotten
    like ancient relics!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_fearful_3: I...I would give all my gold to be gone from
    here!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Flee! I will forfeit my cut but we must flee!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_irrational_0: My shoes are filled with the ocean!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_irrational_1: "...it must be at least 10,000 years old,
    or maybe not?  Who can say?"
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Such finery abounds in this place!  Let
    us live here for our remaining days!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_irrational_3: What is this beautiful place?
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_irrational_4: What smells so delicious?
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: My eyes are opened to new pleasures!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: Let my skin weep blood!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Bathe me in gore and battle!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Only the sufferer appreciates the beauty
    of the whip...
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Break me on your wheel, glorious and terrible
    Fortune!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: My master's influence transcends his prison!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: The relics are mine!  Mine, I tell you!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Keep away! Stay where I can see you!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Keep your knives in sight! You won't get me!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Do you seek my gold? Come and get it!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Your envy is obvious! And stay out of my way!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Whatever I find belongs to me - whatever you
    find...belongs to me!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_selfish_2: My expertise confers me the largest share!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_selfish_3: I deserve better than this!
  antiquarian+str_afflicted_selfish_4: More...more!  I must find more!
  antiquarian+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: Your mother should have done this a long
    time ago!
  antiquarian+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: I will free us from this millstone around
    our necks!
  antiquarian+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: Drop that ham! It's mine!
  antiquarian+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: No harm done, I am made of gold!
  antiquarian+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Don't presume to act surprised! Traitor!
  antiquarian+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: This is how one survives countless conspiracies!
  antiquarian+str_attack_self_depressed_0: Let the last of my blood abandon me as
    fate has!
  antiquarian+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Here Death! I knock at your door!
  antiquarian+str_attack_self_irrational_0: Once more and I win that prize...
  antiquarian+str_attack_self_irrational_1: Quickly - does anyone know the names of
    my hands?!
  antiquarian+str_bark_encourage_0: Our will is focused and clear, they are blinded
    by darkness.
  antiquarian+str_bark_encourage_1: We will leave here burdened with riches!
  antiquarian+str_bark_encourage_2: To vanquish evil and discover what was forgotten
    by history,  glorious!
  antiquarian+str_bark_first_aid_0: I have assisted in many 'experiments', I know
    the body well.
  antiquarian+str_bark_first_aid_1: Bite down on this stick as I work.
  antiquarian+str_bark_first_aid_2: This is a desert remedy made of scorpion venom.
  antiquarian+str_bark_hobby_0: They sang this at an oasis in the Red Desert.
  antiquarian+str_bark_hobby_1: Note the curved filigree. This is centuries old.
  antiquarian+str_bark_hobby_2: These rations are terrible. Not even salted!
  antiquarian+str_bark_pep_talk_0: Just imagine those cool, thick pieces of gold tumbling
    into your hands!
  antiquarian+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Fear is just a bedtime tale we scare ourselves
    with.
  antiquarian+str_bark_pep_talk_2: Gaze into the fire and gather your inner strength!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: I told you not to disturb the relics!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Your bumbling will leave us with nothing!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: You jeopardize your shares,  dolts!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: It amazes me how you dullards can even
    manage to breathe!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Perhaps you should marinade yourselves
    for those who will devour you on the morrow.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: I wonder if those as confused as you
    have a soul...
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: Nightmares when I sleep and nightmares
    when I wake...
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: This is the tragic sum of my decisions.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: My heart is pierced by the thorns
    of failure.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: The censer rattles! He seeks to escape...
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Never cross a sorcerer. You'll never
    sleep again.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: I hear the desecrating drums of foul
    ceremony!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: There are creatures whose only cry
    is to speak your name!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: The void is the source of all cities.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Ware the fire newts! Their tridents
    burn as they pierce!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Please heat the stitching hook in
    the fire.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: Sleep is a pointless state where
    all pain is forgotten.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Who wants to play pinfinger?
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: Conspiracy breeds in sidelong glances
    around the fire...
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: I will only sleep with my back to a
    wall!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: I can take every watch for I will not
    lie near you vipers.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Come! Play  one more round to win your
    share back!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Of course I drank all the wine, I deserve
    it!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: No, I can't go on watch, I must have
    my rest.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Will I be victim of my own ambitions?
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: Gold, silver, relics...shiny dross to lure
    this fool of certain death.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: Hope, it seems, is not for sale.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: I can feel his hand in all of this!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: He is breaking from his prison, he comes
    for me!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: None of us can hide from our pasts...
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: Cuckoo! Cuckoo! It is half past never!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Open my skull and gaze upon the civilization
    therein!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Coffee invigorates badgers yet lulls the
    lion.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Wounds and gashes thrill me beyond reason!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Gold is lovely but this pain is sublime!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Have you ever swooned in the heat of
    battle?
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: One who has served a sorcerer knows evil
    lurks everywhere.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Which of you covets my purse?!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: What you call suspicion, I call being observant!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: I am not here to get my hands dirty!
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: You need me to count the gold, so swing that
    sword.
  antiquarian+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: I find the artifacts,  you kill the fiends.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Do not tarry on this lost soul.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_depressed_1: The sands of time are nearly spilled.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_depressed_2: I am beyond hope and beyond salvation.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_irrational_0: But I haven't won anything!
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_irrational_1: A desert asp?! Is it my birthday?
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_irrational_2: I won't eat anything that was dropped on
    the ground.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: Pain stokes my will!
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: The coward's panacea?
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Leave it be, my agony is perfect.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Save your charms for the gullible!
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: I have bartered in many markets and those
    are crude fakes.
  antiquarian+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: A traitor's favoured ploy, no?
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: Appetite itself has betrayed me.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Hunger reminds me that I still exist.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Please give my share to the paupers.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: Am I to eat that or is it going
    to eat me?
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: I prefer to remain light-headed!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: I am fuelled by the blood of my
    enemies, thank you.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: A meal gratis exists but in flights
    of fancy.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Is this a feast to celebrate my undoing
    at your craven hands?
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Leave me in peace, rabble!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Not interested in helping
    those who can't help themselves.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Confer with only those
    of your status, cur.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: I would rather you left
    me alone.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: My former master whispers
    my sins to me as I sleep.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Why bother? This expedition
    is a sham!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: My mind is without anchor,
    I am awash in terror!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: I cannot find my inner
    locus... Leave me!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: Never let profit drive
    you! It twists the mind and warps intent!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: A flight of bats sleeps
    in my ears!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: I see you are in disguise,
    my liege.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Flames speak in riddles
    if you listen very very closely...
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Forgive me if I see
    your pain as a blessing.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Hah! You jest I assume,
    because that looks wonderful...
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Oh I envy your pain.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: Could there be a more
    poetic avenue of betrayal?
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: How can you feign ignorance
    when your actions speak of betrayal?
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: How can I help you slip
    a knife between my ribs?
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: Maybe later? I'm busy resting
    my eyes.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: Sign over your share and
    I'll consider it.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: This trinket needs more
    study as it appears to be of some value!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Incompetence repulses me.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: Keep your farmhouse remedies,  oaf.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: We are but ciphers in the
    algebra of the spheres!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: Ring me once, the sun falls,
    ring me twice - grow shadows tall.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Speak softly the agony
    is peaking...
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: Unnecessary, my wounds
    bring clarity to my endeavors.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: What a strange and sudden
    interest in my well-being!
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: A shame you are not more
    aware of your overt duplicity.
  antiquarian+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_2: Not shy about your craven
    ways eh?
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed: If it is to be my end, then we must
    all die!
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: I must wait till the full moon
    for my true love to appear!
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: Now my very body will become
    a precious relic itself!
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: This arena of agony pleases
    me too much to leave it!
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Stay with me and learn the pleasure
    beyond the pain!
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: I will do whatever it takes to
    foul your plan and survive!
  antiquarian+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: I wouldn't follow you into Gehenna!
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_depressed_0: Futile.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_depressed_1: No, I must let fate do its worst.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Everything is blue in this world.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_irrational_0: That is strictly for the Garden of Arcane
    Delights.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Excuse me, I asked for poison.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_irrational_2: How is it you can see me?  Am I not invisible?
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: This dolor is too precious.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: Life is too short to dull experience.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: I was hoping for some salt...
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Tainted and caustic I presume.
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: What fraud is this?
  antiquarian+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Such obvious deceit!
  antiquarian+str_block_item_depressed_0: Do you offer one who is drowning more water?
  antiquarian+str_block_item_depressed_1: It can't help, whatever it is.
  antiquarian+str_block_item_irrational_0: Forget it, we are through!
  antiquarian+str_block_item_irrational_1: I asked for a skull and you bring me a
    bauble. Fah!
  antiquarian+str_block_item_masochistic_0: If it doesn't wound, gash, cut or slice,
    I don't want it.
  antiquarian+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Hah, a weakling's recourse!
  antiquarian+str_block_item_paranoid_0: Poison is more of the coward's way, isn't
    it?
  antiquarian+str_block_item_paranoid_1: So suddnely keen to help?
  antiquarian+str_block_move_abusive_0: Pester those who care for your ideas!
  antiquarian+str_block_move_abusive_1: Your preferences are of no consequence.
  antiquarian+str_block_move_fearful_0: Terror overwhelms my faculties!
  antiquarian+str_block_move_fearful_1: I balk...
  antiquarian+str_block_move_irrational_0: Lead boots, can't ya see dearie?
  antiquarian+str_block_move_irrational_1: I am hexed! Again!
  antiquarian+str_block_move_masochistic_0: Here I will meet the glory of battle and
    suffering!
  antiquarian+str_block_move_masochistic_1: I crave the deep ecstacy of violence!
    So here I stand!
  antiquarian+str_block_move_paranoid_0: It is clear I must disobey to survive!
  antiquarian+str_block_move_paranoid_1: I will not be patsy to your plotting!
  antiquarian+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Stir! Rise and stir your resolve!
  antiquarian+str_buff_party_powerful_1: "...and thus they will crumble, like ancient
    stone."
  antiquarian+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: I picked up a few tricks from
    my old master...
  antiquarian+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Be calm, still your minds.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: Courage, for a finite instant, rekindled
    my cowardice.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: A coward perhaps, but gravedirt smothers
    all courage.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: I believe in nothing.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_irrational_0: A parade that runs backwards! What
    fun!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_irrational_1: The sun wills it! The mind is compelled!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_irrational_2: The floor is covered in gold!  Gold!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: I will not remain here to be stabbed
    in the back!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: I would keep you all before me, snakes!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: Traitors never dare attack the front!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: I must take inventory of my spoils...
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Trust me, I have a plan.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: I can command more effectively from here!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fearful_0: No! No! NO!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fearful_1: Bravery! Foolish notion!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fearful_2: E-excuse me...I must...check on something...
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: Why fight the push of blind ambition?
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: To those I have betrayed, I offer myself
    in penance.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: At least in confronting death so do
    I find undeserved nobility.
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: What a lovely trail of breadcrumbs!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: Out of the way! The last ham is for
    me!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Is that from the Huang dynasty?  I
    must be sure...
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Please! I would lead the charge!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: There is no shame in seeking pain!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Agony, I come!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: I won't let any of you take more than
    your worth!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: What is that?  I must have it!
  antiquarian+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: I'll do anything for a bigger share!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Have you no other recourse?
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: And now it will rage on the rest
    of us!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Oh lovely! Your dreams are
    coming true!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Did anyone here fund an expedition
    to the wastes?
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Thankfully I am the most valuable
    one here!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: My next blow will put that to
    shame!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Did no one tell you you only
    get one chance?
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Perhaps you lack the qualities
    needed.
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: I see us all dead, heads on
    stakes and bodies in cauldrons!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: We are caught in a trap of
    our own devising!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: What a terrifying din,
    please keep it down.
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: Alas this party is off
    to a clumsy start.
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: What a twisted will you must
    have to fight alongside them!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: That looked rehearesed!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: It always seems to fall to
    me, doesn't it?
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: You forfeit your share of
    the loot!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: I am glad for you have no value. No
    purpose.
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: If you die then we all get a greater
    share, no?
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: If you fall then our fate is sealed!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Why aren't we fleeing?!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: And that is why you never look a
    rock in the eye!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: Wait! All of my eggs are in one basket!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Stop, I'm positively salivating.
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Fortune surely smiles upon you!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: Perhaps you aren't colluding with them,
    after all...
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Intrigue and treachery abound!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: Another inch and the tides would
    have turned against us!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: A cat toying with a mouse...
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: An owl cried and all arms fell
    silent.
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Shifting sands under hollow stars...
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: You can't fool me with that pantomime!
  antiquarian+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: A convenience rooted in conspiracy!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: He cannot pursue me beyond death...
    I hope.
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: Suicide or protracted agony?  I know
    which is more noble.
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: Slip into my wounds and I will hide
    you!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: I am feeling a little thirsty, catch
    the blood in your goblet.
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Why wait for a lucky swing..?
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: My patience has a limit - their
    aim is sloppy!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: Perhaps I should spoil your conspiracy!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: If you wish to kill me then strike
    now traitors!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Every wound brings more glory!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: You'll miss me when I'm gone!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: It is only a matter of time...
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: That was a warning!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: A flight of whip-poor-wills!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Hold the mirror still, I can hardly
    see myself!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: No! Try again! I will reward
    your accuracy!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Give me cause to stitch my flesh!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: A sign of disloyalty among us!
  antiquarian+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: Friend and foe mingle to conspire
    against me!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_0: Exquisite!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_1: Sublime!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_2: My eyes find all weakness!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_3: By my hand, fall!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_4: My will is without equal!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_5: Dishonorable cur!
  antiquarian+str_critbyhero_6: Die and wither!
  antiquarian+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: These wounds weren't as bad as I thought.
  antiquarian+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: A few stitches and I'm back in it!
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: Nothing I do will change the outcome,
    anyway.
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: Death will find me no matter what.
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: No mortal can defy the tangled skein.
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: I...I don't know what to do next!
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: What will become of me if I do?! Or if
    I don't?!
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: Arms and legs numb, gaze unseeing...
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Imagine, all the abacuses in the world
    connected!
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Just a moment, I'm reflecting on my
    greatest finds...
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Excuse my foolishness but I forgot
    my legs today...
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: My censer rattles to warn me...
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I am not looking to die with a knife
    in the back.
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: Foul viper! I would live a bit longer!
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: Hah! A fool's recourse!
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: I have devised a far more clever course
    of action.
  antiquarian+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: I would rather live to right another day,
    yes?
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_depressed_0: Ironic that this brazen act was born of cowardice!
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Defend me if you wish, but I aim to die!
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Cupid find me!
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_irrational_1: I am aligned with the stars of hell!
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: A ward to call down penury!
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Thrill me with your blows!
  antiquarian+str_mark_self_masochistic_2: Fortune, bend their swings towards my flesh!
  antiquarian+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: I killed him... please let him stay
    dead!
  antiquarian+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: I am still corrupted by the will
    of my long-dead master!
  antiquarian+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: I feel his evil pouring forth from
    the censer!
  antiquarian+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: So I'm the final antique,
    yet nothing will be around to collect...
  antiquarian+str_random_command_abusive_0: What do I care of what you want, dolt?
  antiquarian+str_random_command_abusive_1: Does the lion do what the sheep demands
    of it?
  antiquarian+str_random_command_abusive_2: What a presumptuous degenerate!
  antiquarian+str_random_command_depressed_0: Why should I care?
  antiquarian+str_random_command_depressed_1: Every step leads me to the blackest
    pit.
  antiquarian+str_random_command_depressed_2: My soul is forfeit, my will is shattered.
  antiquarian+str_random_command_irrational_0: The King's Gardens are a marvel aren't
    they darling?
  antiquarian+str_random_command_irrational_1: This market is a tad crowded...
  antiquarian+str_random_command_irrational_2: This is best impression of a precious
    vase...
  antiquarian+str_random_command_masochistic_0: I swoon from bloodlust!
  antiquarian+str_random_command_masochistic_1: My mind is seduced! I surrender myself
    to my darkest desires...
  antiquarian+str_random_command_masochistic_2: Is battle not the sweetest dance of
    them all?
  antiquarian+str_random_command_paranoid_0: Unpredictability delays the knife in
    the back!
  antiquarian+str_random_command_paranoid_1: If they can read my thoughts then I will
    cease thinking.
  antiquarian+str_random_command_paranoid_2: They covet my wealth!
  antiquarian+str_random_command_selfish_0: My fate takes precedence!
  antiquarian+str_random_command_selfish_1: I am no simple minion!
  antiquarian+str_random_command_selfish_2: I'm far too important!
  antiquarian+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: The sweet smell of profit!
  antiquarian+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Where there is adversity, so too
    opportunity!
  antiquarian+str_stress_heal_stalwart_0: I am renewed!
  antiquarian+str_stress_heal_stalwart_1: Vindicated!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_courageous_0: He serves me now, and I have his power!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_courageous_1: I tremble with ancient powers! We press harder!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_courageous_2: Gold will rain down upon us!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_focused_0: Do not fear these cowards!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_focused_1: Fate flies the flag of our victory!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_powerful_0: I will tear victory from the maw of doom!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_powerful_1: Woe to those who get in my way!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_stalwart_0: We can finish this expedition!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_stalwart_1: It is all downhill from here!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_stalwart_2: Persist! Transcend!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_stalwart_3: There is no profit without struggle!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_stalwart_4: Straighten your backs! We continue!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_vigorous_0: My will is brilliant and terrible!
  antiquarian+str_virtued_vigorous_1: Roll up your sleeves! Profit requires toil!
arbalest:
  arbalest+str_afflicted_abusive_0: My herbs and stitches are wasted on you louts!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_abusive_1: Surrounded by untrained dolts!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_abusive_2: You are just the meat between my arbalest and
    our foes.
  arbalest+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Dullards! You will not last another hour!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_abusive_4: You couldn't handle the road I have ridden, louts!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_depressed_0: What is it I ran away from?
  arbalest+str_afflicted_depressed_1: What a fool I was to try and prove myself!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_depressed_2: My aim is as faulty as my heart!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_depressed_3: Grim thoughts circle my head like buzzards!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_depressed_4: My string is frayed, my soul quails.
  arbalest+str_afflicted_fearful_0: I can feel Death's sights on my heart!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_fearful_1: The front line will fall!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_fearful_2: N-no!  No more!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Nothing can stop these fiends!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Defeat! Despair! DEATH!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_irrational_0: I am fluent in the language of feathers!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_irrational_1: Silence, my arbalest sings!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_irrational_2: I must go back and find my missing bolts!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_irrational_3: Three stars, two moons, one horse.
  arbalest+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will
    you marry me?
  arbalest+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Give me more! I've endured worse!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: The pain focuses my aim!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Wounds heal but glory never fades!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Ah what a bloody delight to do battle!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: The agony quickens the pulse!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Surrounded by servants of Darkness!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Which of you bumped my arm?!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Who here parlays with shadows?
  arbalest+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Deceive me at your peril!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Comrades?!  Enemies?!  All have it in for me!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_selfish_0: I do in one shot what takes you a dozen swings.
  arbalest+str_afflicted_selfish_1: I deserve twice as much as you inefficient louts.
  arbalest+str_afflicted_selfish_2: My aim grows more true as my share increases.
  arbalest+str_afflicted_selfish_3: It seems I am the only one truly made for this
    adventure!
  arbalest+str_afflicted_selfish_4: You need me to watch the flanks!
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: I never hit anything, or anyone, by accident.
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: That was for jostling my aim earlier.
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_abusive_2: Years on the road and I still encounter
    fools.
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: This is a common treatment in the Far
    East.
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: Bees! Full of bees!
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Flee betrayer!
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Yes, I know your plots!
  arbalest+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_2: I spied you tampering with my weapon!
  arbalest+str_attack_self_depressed_0: At least I can decide how I am to die.
  arbalest+str_attack_self_depressed_1: It must end.
  arbalest+str_attack_self_irrational_0: If it whispers for my blood...
  arbalest+str_attack_self_irrational_1: I was right! Bells in my veins!
  arbalest+str_attack_self_irrational_2: One, two, three...FOUR!
  arbalest+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: I can see clearly!
  arbalest+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Now I am ready!
  arbalest+str_attack_self_masochistic_2: My aim is steadied!
  arbalest+str_bark_encourage_0: Focus on victory!
  arbalest+str_bark_encourage_1: Think of the songs they will sing for us!
  arbalest+str_bark_encourage_2: Stories will be told of our battles!
  arbalest+str_bark_first_aid_0: I learned how to stitch from battle nuns in the desert
    kingdoms.
  arbalest+str_bark_first_aid_1: This poultice has saved many worse off than you.
  arbalest+str_bark_first_aid_2: Drink this and you will live, I hope.
  arbalest+str_bark_hobby_0: Put this apple on your head and close your eyes.
  arbalest+str_bark_hobby_1: I will stick with you until wanderlust strikes again.
  arbalest+str_bark_hobby_2: Dice? What's the wager?
  arbalest+str_bark_pep_talk_0: I will show you a trick of the will I learned in my
    travels.
  arbalest+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Be calm, my arbalest will slay those who threaten.
  arbalest+str_bark_pep_talk_2: If it bleeds, we can slay it.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: Hold still so I can aim!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Down in front or feel my bolts!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: A bolt for your back if you block my aim again!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Keep away from my arbalest! Too fine an
    instrument for your dull hands.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: May you dream courage into your hollow
    hearts.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: I hope you suffocate on your snores.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: I have lost my way on this road.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: What I would give to be home again, a
    wiser daughter.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: I cannot recall a single target struck
    today.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: This trail leads to ruin.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Did you feel that chill?
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: We journey through darkness itself!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: I'll need three fingers for this magic
    trick.  Volunteers?
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: Tie me down as I sleep to keep the owls
    from taking me away!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Still your hearts, they keep me awake!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: These wounds stand testament to my
    deeds.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: Some herbs heal and soothe, these burn
    and purify.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: No better lullaby than the stitching
    of flesh.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: I will sleep with my finger on the trigger.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Any of you could be with them. Any of
    you!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: I see creeping shapes just beyond the
    fire's light.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_3: Someone speaks to the darkness!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: I'll sleep closest to the fire.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: I barely have enough tincture for myself.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Sort the watches between you, I deserve
    a night's rest.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Could I hit the long side of a barley house?
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: Am I still just a runaway?
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: Home calls me, but the way is lost.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: My sights shake, my breath trips and stumbles!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: They are beyond my range!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: My bolts mean nothing!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: A bird for a bolt and a bolt for a fish.
    A blue fish.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: My harp has but one string!  My song is a
    death rattle.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: I shall have to remember this funny dream
    when I awaken.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Pain steadies my aim.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Each scar is a seal proving my worth!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: This road has been one long delicious trial!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: One of you has frayed my cord!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: My herbs are fouled! But by whom?!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: A trap! Surely this is a trap!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: I hope my superior skill inspires you all!
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: I charge per kill, as my contract states.
  arbalest+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: Perhaps you have forgotten whose bolts saved
    your hide?
  arbalest+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Death has found me.
  arbalest+str_block_buff_depressed_1: It would not be enough.
  arbalest+str_block_buff_depressed_2: Oh give up on me already.
  arbalest+str_block_buff_irrational_0: No that tickles!
  arbalest+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Can't catch me!
  arbalest+str_block_buff_irrational_2: NOOOO!
  arbalest+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: That would lessen the thrill!
  arbalest+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: I must remain keen and sharp!
  arbalest+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: My aim becomes still with pain.
  arbalest+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Spare me your tricks, fiend!
  arbalest+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: Never trust a smiling fox.
  arbalest+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: Too freely given.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: None for me, not hungry.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Just let me lie down.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: I've already had my fill of hair.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: That will surely give me the toots,
    and we are in court!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: A heavy stomach dulls the fight.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: I need clarity to keep my sights
    steady.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: More belladonna, eh?
  arbalest+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Something was slipped in the food!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Show some steel first.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Earn it.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: A waste of time.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: I am too lost in shadow.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: My heart is not into it.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: I would foul it up. Again.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: I cannot focus, my soul quakes.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: My hands shake so.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: I am vexed by the shadows.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: I cannot say I liked your
    poem.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: I am on a road borne by
    the wind!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Cut a vein and see what
    scripture flows.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Life gains more purpose
    at the edge!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Feel the burn and let
    it fire your spirit!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Luxury spoils the soldier.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: That one plots against me.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Feigning an injury to lure
    me into danger.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: Better to trust no one right
    now.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: I need my rest.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: I am tired, leave me be.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: And then help you again tomorrow?
    Fah!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: From you? No.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: Unproven whelp.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Not worth your time.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Save it for someone worthy.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: Hullo Mr. Ghost, will it be
    ham or sausage this time?
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: Shall we play Ring a Ring
    o' Roses instead?
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: That would dishonor the spirit
    of battle.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: I yearn to thrive on the
    unbearable.
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: Not from you, not from anyone
    here!
  arbalest+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: Your cowardly stare betrays
    you.
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: This road seems headed for ruin.
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: Onwards to my bloody ending.
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: I was picnicking with these fine
    stones, if you don't mind.
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: The rain speaks to me with one thousand
    tongues!
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Not until the bitter end!
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: This journey won't end in cowardice!
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: I sense a trap!
  arbalest+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: Why so keen to leave?
  arbalest+str_block_heal_depressed_0: No. Wounds are inevitable.
  arbalest+str_block_heal_depressed_1: No bandage can mend my despair.
  arbalest+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Save it for a better soldier.
  arbalest+str_block_heal_irrational_0: Scorpions!
  arbalest+str_block_heal_irrational_1: I'll take an ale instead.
  arbalest+str_block_heal_irrational_2: Who are you?!
  arbalest+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Such sweet wounds, leave them!
  arbalest+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: These wounds are finer than any medal!
  arbalest+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: You insult my valour!
  arbalest+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: I'll prepare my own treatments!
  arbalest+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: That reeks of belladonna.
  arbalest+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Far too convenient.
  arbalest+str_block_item_depressed_0: No, I am not worthy.
  arbalest+str_block_item_depressed_1: I am too eager to die.
  arbalest+str_block_item_irrational_0: I cannot pay for your wares, kind merchant.
  arbalest+str_block_item_irrational_1: I only trade in the finest tobacco.
  arbalest+str_block_item_masochistic_0: What glory is there in begging for aid?
  arbalest+str_block_item_masochistic_1: I already feel so alive!
  arbalest+str_block_item_paranoid_0: I'll stick to my own tinctures.
  arbalest+str_block_item_paranoid_1: I question your intent!
  arbalest+str_block_move_abusive_0: Think any of you can make me?
  arbalest+str_block_move_abusive_1: Back off.
  arbalest+str_block_move_fearful_0: Just let it be over with!
  arbalest+str_block_move_fearful_1: I am frozen in Death's gaze!
  arbalest+str_block_move_irrational_0: Tentacles?! Not again!
  arbalest+str_block_move_irrational_1: This spot finally got some sunshine!
  arbalest+str_block_move_masochistic_0: Just when the fight is getting good and bloody?
  arbalest+str_block_move_masochistic_1: I can hit anything, no matter the danger!
  arbalest+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Into your trap?! Never!
  arbalest+str_block_move_paranoid_1: I can sight all you traitors from here!
  arbalest+str_buff_party_powerful_0: I have the flanks covered, press hard!
  arbalest+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Feel no fear, I will shoot those who threaten!
  arbalest+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Breathe like this and feel the
    calm grow.
  arbalest+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Hold this powder under your tongue.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I am not meant for great things after
    all.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: I should have stayed home like a faithful
    daughter.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: This whole journey has been one big fool's
    errand.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: Too near!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: They can reach me! Back!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Help!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_irrational_0: The ground was getting too hot!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_irrational_1: I am the wind itself!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_irrational_2: And queen takes knight! Checkmate!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: Your ruse would lure me out of position!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: I would feel better with you in front.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: You would abandon our flanks!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: My arbalest is too fine to risk!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I cannot risk injury!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: A general's daughter on the front line?
    Hah!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: I might be able to hit something from here.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: I am more useful taking their blows.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Come Death! Claim me!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: My bolts tire of such long flights.
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: The parade almost trod me over!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Have you ever tried to argue with your
    feet? Pointless!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Life is made true through suffering!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Ah what tales my stitches will tell!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: I cannot help it! I hunger for blows!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: So it falls to me!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Once again I have to win the battle myself!
  arbalest+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: Glory calls me, and me alone, it seems!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: A clumsy blow.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: Such brutish flailing.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Marionette strings?!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: The moon is rather loud today.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: I had that one in my sights!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: I was about to fire!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Why do you even bother?
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Oh don't tease the enemy so.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: We are done for!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Your failure has doomed us!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: A swarm of beds!? Here?!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: It is wise to ask permission
    of the weapon first.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Traitor!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You betray us!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: I am not paid enough to fight
    for the both of us.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: I would have made that shot!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: Just keep them back so that I can fire!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: Now you learn about battle.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: They will flay us one by one.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Can my bolts stop this?
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Oh my! What a delightful funeral!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: When the spirits offer you ribbons,
    always refuse.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: What I would give to trade places with
    you.
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: How agony blesses you!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: Who among us is the traitor?!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Which of you gave us away?!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: The bell tolls for us all!
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: Will I be next?
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Why are they applauding?
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Have you ever seen a colour out of
    space?
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: Hard to strike a friend, isn't it?
  arbalest+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: Is there a monster hiding among us?
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: I am not ready for you, Death!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: More will surely follow.
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: T'keleli! T'keleli!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Metal! Claw! Blade! Tooth!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: This! This is living!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: A proper battle!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: Come out traitors! I am not afraid!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: The trap is sprung!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Tired of my unerring bolts eh?
  arbalest+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Only I could have survived that!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: My entire life!  Revealed to me in a
    vision!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: This is too much!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: You have slain Sir Withers!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Sounds a bit flat to my ears but
    I'm just a soldier.
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Hell's fires! Do I have to help
    you aim?
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Oh you tease me!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: You all let this happen!
  arbalest+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: How easily that one slipped through!
  arbalest+str_critbyhero_0: Hell's fires I'm good!
  arbalest+str_critbyhero_2: Bull's eye!
  arbalest+str_critbyhero_3: Naturally.
  arbalest+str_critbyhero_4: A bloody good shot!
  arbalest+str_critbyhero_5: Exactly where I called it!
  arbalest+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Taught myself this concoction in my last campaign.
  arbalest+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: This herb is toxic when taken under a gibbous
    moon.
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: I cannot hold my aim steady.
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: I can barely crank my weapon.
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: Happy endings are only happen in children's
    tales.
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Which path is safe?!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: I am fixed in Death's gaze!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: I..am frozen..
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: We are but puppets in a giant play!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: What spell does the wind weave upon my
    feet?!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Terriers! In my boots!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: I am surrounded! To move is certain death!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I will not show my back to you craven fiends!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: They know where I will aim!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I am adjusting my sights!
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: I have earned this rest.
  arbalest+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: I need more time to sight my prey.
  arbalest+str_mark_self_depressed_0: I am without recourse, all hope gone.
  arbalest+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Let them aim at the least of us.
  arbalest+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Those beyond the stars need my blood to come
    through!
  arbalest+str_mark_self_irrational_1: You are all welcome for tea!
  arbalest+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: There is joy in shooting and being shot!
  arbalest+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Am I not armored?  Try me!
  arbalest+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: Why did I run away?!
  arbalest+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: All of my regrets! My misdeeds!
  arbalest+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: My heart burns with regret!
  arbalest+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Please, no! I want to live!
  arbalest+str_random_command_abusive_0: Confused? Of course you are.
  arbalest+str_random_command_abusive_1: Watch and learn, for once!
  arbalest+str_random_command_abusive_2: A coward could never understand!
  arbalest+str_random_command_depressed_0: Every choice leads to ruin.
  arbalest+str_random_command_depressed_1: If I could steady my aim for just one more
    shot.
  arbalest+str_random_command_depressed_2: Strange whims are all that move me now.
  arbalest+str_random_command_irrational_0: Who has taken all the ducks away?
  arbalest+str_random_command_irrational_1: An arbalest that fires arbalests?!
  arbalest+str_random_command_irrational_2: I know where there is a door to the Moon
    itself!
  arbalest+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Blood! Mine or theirs, what does it matter?
  arbalest+str_random_command_masochistic_1: I seek the glory of bloody battle!
  arbalest+str_random_command_masochistic_2: The pandemonium rules my heart!
  arbalest+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I will foil their conspiracy!
  arbalest+str_random_command_paranoid_1: They try to surround me!
  arbalest+str_random_command_paranoid_2: I will fight you all if I must!
  arbalest+str_random_command_selfish_0: I will pick my own targets and position!
  arbalest+str_random_command_selfish_1: I have earned the right to do as I please!
  arbalest+str_random_command_selfish_2: My aim is my own!
  arbalest+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: A special tincture that soothes the
    spirit.
  arbalest+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: This infusion will cool your thoughts.
  arbalest+str_stress_heal_stalwart_0: These are small bumps on life's long road.
  arbalest+str_stress_heal_stalwart_1: A steady heart makes for a steady hand.
  arbalest+str_virtued_courageous_0: I cannot miss!
  arbalest+str_virtued_courageous_1: We can beat them all!
  arbalest+str_virtued_focused_0: The enemy cannot escape my sights.
  arbalest+str_virtued_focused_1: Target sighted.
  arbalest+str_virtued_powerful_0: Hah! My bolts know their eyes!
  arbalest+str_virtued_powerful_1: I have sighted their weaknesses!
  arbalest+str_virtued_stalwart_0: The highest inspiration guides my sights!
  arbalest+str_virtued_stalwart_1: None shall take our flanks!
  arbalest+str_virtued_vigorous_0: I can see for miles!
  arbalest+str_virtued_vigorous_1: Hold that line and my bolts will fly true!
bounty_hunter:
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_abusive_0: Foul brigands!
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_abusive_1: Blackguards, all!
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_abusive_2: You tenderfoot fools!
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Anger me and you roll the dice.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Life. What a pot of dung.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_depressed_2: "... Shoulda written a will."
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_depressed_3: Lucky I've lived this long, I suppose.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_depressed_4: Been luckier'n most. But luck always runs
    out.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_fearful_0: Curse this place!
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_fearful_1: No shame in folding early. I like to keep
    my winnings.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_fearful_2: We've been dealt out! Let us go!
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_fearful_3: "..."
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_fearful_4: It's a bad hand. That's all there is to it.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_irrational_0: My face is the mask, and the mask my face!
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_irrational_1: I shall take out a bounty - on myself!
    Hehehehe
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Would've made a damn fine baker. Tsk.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Bring me a small dog. So crunchy. Mmm.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Hmph. Blood's merely an expense in my
    line of work.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: Pain? (snort)
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Let them come.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: You wound me, and I'll be impressed.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: "(growl)"
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Cut me in proper. Or else.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Don't you cheat me... the deal was twenty-five
    percent.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Streak's about to run dry. You'll see.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: hmph...you are all sneaks.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Oops - was my take the largest?  Shame that.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_selfish_1: I make my own luck. Especially when no one's
    looking.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_selfish_2: I take what I wish.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_selfish_3: One hay-penny short... Someone is going to
    die.
  bounty_hunter+str_afflicted_selfish_4: Fun... but I don't do this for free.
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: (spits) There's what I think of this
    "alliance."
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: I am weary of your whining!
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: HRRRAAAAA!
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Backstabbing liar!
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Been waiting for this moment!
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_self_depressed_0: That's enough... More than enough.
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_self_depressed_1: I've had it with this life...
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_self_irrational_0: "(insane grunting and panting)"
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: Calm down... calm down... there we
    are...
  bounty_hunter+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Blood. Blood. Mmmmm...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_deathsdoor: One last throw of the dice...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_encourage_0: You fight well enough. So quit your moaning.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_encourage_1: Keep your head down. That's how you survive.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_encourage_2: Hold your weapon lower. Loosen your grip. ...
    There.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_first_aid_0: Here. Put on this bandage.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_first_aid_1: Barely a scratch. Get up.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_first_aid_2: You rolled the dice, friend, but you'll live.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_hobby_0: A little time to reflect on my strategies.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_hobby_1: Hold this apple on your head. Now stand still.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_hobby_2: I will practice.  Train.  A professional adheres
    to a regimen.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_pep_talk_0: We seem... capable enough.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_pep_talk_1: We'll survive. This I know.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_pep_talk_2: The odds seem to be in our favour.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: I'm the only professional here, aren't
    I?
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Amateurs - curse you!
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: You bickering old hens. Shut the hell
    up.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Quiet yourself. Or I'll do it for
    you.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: You simpering clotpoles. You'll talk
    us all to death.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: "(sigh) Could be plundering villages
    right now..."
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: We're all gonna die. Know that,
    and move on.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: What was that?? You hear that??
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: We're dead. Pray to your gods or whate'er
    you do.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: We have no chance. They've sussed
    us.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Been an age since I saw the sun...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: I feel like fighting... You --
    draw your blade!
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: I like your smell. Like burnt dog.
    (big sniff)
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: One cut for every enemy I've killed...
    eeehh.... There.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: Drink enough and the pain turns
    to pleasure.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Just a simple game of knives...
    what's the harm? Heh.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: You smell that? We're being hunted.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Some foul whisper on the wind....
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Eat your share, and no more. I'm
    watching...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Hmph... This job's practically charity.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Think I'm actually losing money on
    this expedition...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: You want me to... share... my pipe-weed?
    AH-HA-HAAAAA!
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Snake eyes again...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: This job's impossible.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Smells of death here.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: "... Bloody gamble from the start."
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: It'll split a hair, smith... or it'll
    split your head.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: That ale falls to half and I'll cut
    you likewise.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Cut me in, brother. I've a mind to murder.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Not a weapon's been made hasn't cut
    me.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Bloody me? Aye... if you can.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: Look in those eyes... Liars, all.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Something's not right. Think we been had...
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Twenty-five percent... What hogwash.
  bounty_hunter+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Never done so much for so little...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_depressed_1: No. Just go away.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_depressed_2: Don't waste it on me.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Touch me and die.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_irrational_2: Back! Back, you demon!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: No... I enjoy the test.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: Foolishness. Only blood begets blood.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Nay. Let them ply their bloody trade.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: No more of your interference!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: "(snort) I fare well enough on my own."
  bounty_hunter+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: You stay away from me...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I cannot... I... I am not hungry,
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Begone. Leave me to my thoughts.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Pluck the wings, then watch it
    squirm...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: Like meat in the stew... meat
    in the stew... meat, meat...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: I never eat while on the hunt.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: No. Ravenous is as ravenous
    does.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: I don't trust you.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: "(spits) Poison!"
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Sod off.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: "(groan)... You bore
    me."
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Weaklings!  Tend to yourselves!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: Leave me alone.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Why? We've played and
    lost, plain and simple.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: I keep telling you there's
    NO TIME!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: They will SLAUGHTER US!
    We should go!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: Leave me! Can't you
    see I've got him right where I want him?
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Why - I've forgotten
    what I look like under this death shroud!  Let me look...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: No. I like blood.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: I'd rather see you
    fight through it.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Think I need to teach
    you a lesson about suffering.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: Ha. I think not.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Where is my cowl?! WHERRRE
    IS IT?!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: Forget it. They are
    not my allies...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: '... I look like a "nice"
    person to you?'
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: I'm busy... counting
    my coin.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: What I need is a nap,
    and what I need comes first.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Feh - there's no value in
    the clumsy ministrations of an amateur...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: No. Your silence is blessing
    enough.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Just leave me alone...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: You waste your time on
    me...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: Did I finish that last
    job?  Is it done?  I cannot be sure...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: Come.  No.  Closer.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Nah. Rather like a little
    misery.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: It's nothing serious.
    Begone.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: Stay away from me.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: What's this? More "majick?"
    (snort)
  bounty_hunter+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_2: Keep your sorcery to yourself.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: Sleep in the bed what you made,
    I say.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: "(snort) Kill or be killed,
    I say."
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: MY BLOOD AND MY HATE!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: grrrrRRRRRRRAAAAAA!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: One more... just one more...
    COME ON, YE BASTARDS!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Haven't near bled enough.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: "(spits) Knew you'd try to swindle
    me!"
  bounty_hunter+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: Right into a bigger trap, I bet!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_depressed_0: No... no, I've had enough.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_depressed_1: You can't help me.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Begone. Leave me to my end.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_irrational_0: Touch me and draw back a stump.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_irrational_1: RAAAAAAH!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_irrational_2: NAY! I AM INVINCIBLE!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: I chose this line of work for a reason!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: I need your help, I'll bloody well ask
    for it.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: I'm no child. I can suffer pain.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: "(snarl)"
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: Don't you touch me.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Back. I know what you want.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_depressed_0: Stay back. I'm not worth it...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_depressed_1: It's useless! Leave me be!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_irrational_1: I said I wanted a pony!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_masochistic_0: What's wrong with a little pain? (snickers)
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Feck off. I rather like this.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_paranoid_0: "(bats away your hand) Don't touch me!"
  bounty_hunter+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Ha! You've always thought I was weak!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_abusive_0: Shove me again and I'll put you down.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_abusive_1: Stay put. Or I'll knock you sideways.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_fearful_0: Stay put! Or you'll be a deader!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_fearful_1: Can't... move... my legs!
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_irrational_0: "(seething) I hate you! AAAAAAH!"
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_irrational_1: "(draws finger across throat and glares
    at you)"
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_masochistic_0: No. I die here.
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_masochistic_1: 'This dirt will do... All ye creatures:
    COME!'
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_paranoid_0: No. Stay there, so I can see you...
  bounty_hunter+str_block_move_paranoid_1: You WOULD like that...
  bounty_hunter+str_buff_party_powerful_0: RAAAAAAAAH!
  bounty_hunter+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Win this, and the tavern's on me.
  bounty_hunter+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: "(slaps ally) Focus up, damn
    you - now is the time to hunt!"
  bounty_hunter+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Get angry, get even!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: Not putting my neck on the line for
    this...
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: I slink back to the shadows...
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Bah. To hell with it.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: Back up! Bloody hell, BACK UP!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Move it!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: I must...retreat!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: Can't let that one see me... So familiar...
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: I know that one... Did you follow
    me?!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: More are coming! I know it!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Think you can do better? Be my guest.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Not paid enough for this...
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: That's enough getting beat on. Your
    turn.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Nothin' for it, I suppose.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: This way, that way, it matters not.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: I'm retreating - or not?!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: I'm folding a flush!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Try that on me. Go on... try it.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Cut me! Come on, ye blaggard, CUT
    ME!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: RAAAH!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Get out of my way!
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: That one's mine.
  bounty_hunter+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: Move your ass! You're blocking me!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Hmph. A child could do better.
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: You could have killed it, had
    you any skill.
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: YES! SLAUGHTER THEM!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Steal my kill and I'll gut
    you.
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Hmph. You owe me one.
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Get out of my way! You're fouling
    up my aim!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: You pathetic twit!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Quit fooling about! Or I'll
    kill you myself...
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: Some foul nightmare...
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: We've got no chance... We
    should run!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: IDIOT! IDIIIIIOOOOOOOT!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: Better sleep with one
    eye open, you charlatan...
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: I knew it... You're with
    them!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You backstabbing son of
    a...
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Stupid child! You don't
    deserve your twenty-five percent!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: They should give me your
    share...
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: Pathetic. (spits)
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: No... NOOOOOO!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: RUUUUN!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Death! Death! DEAAAAATH!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: No. ... I SAID NO, WOMAN!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: "(creepy grunt)"
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: I told you! They know our weaknesses!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Someone fouled up!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: That's it! We've been dealt out!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: We should flee... There's nothing
    for us here!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: "(cuts self)"
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: "(drools)"
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: Huh. How easily they missed you...
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: Ungh.... It is too strong! We should
    flee!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: Aw blast... you pitiless bastard!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Ace of spades. Your call.
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: HA! Fine work, friend!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Yes, yes, NOW I'm awake!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: Too strong! They know our weaknesses!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: "... Someone told them where we'd
    be!"
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: GRRR! One more like that and you're
    on your own!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Get out of my way! LEMME AT 'EM!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: My strike is not so true! I am...
    failing!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: "(desperate growl)"
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: "(snarling like a rabid weasel)"
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: No, NO! You pitiful thing!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Come on, hit me! HIIIIT MEEEE!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: Bastard is after my coin! STAY
    BACK!
  bounty_hunter+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: You LET it come at me! TRAITOR!
  bounty_hunter+str_critbyhero_0: I know just where you're weakest!
  bounty_hunter+str_critbyhero_2: Hmph.
  bounty_hunter+str_critbyhero_3: I've come to collect!
  bounty_hunter+str_critbyhero_4: Called your bluff, friend.
  bounty_hunter+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Nothing will stop me.
  bounty_hunter+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: Bloody cakewalk.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: Bloody hell, why?
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: I didn't plan for this...I should
    have.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Not on your bloody life.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: No! Every hunter knows when they have
    become the prey!
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: No. Bad Idea.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Not moving 'til I get that roast
    pheasant I'm owed.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: I must sharpen my axe, plan my attack!
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Only if you triple my pay. Nay --
    quadruple.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: No - they'll expect that!
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: No. They'll see that coming.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: And play right into their hands? Foolish.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I charge double for that.
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: "... That wasn't in my contract."
  bounty_hunter+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: Best you let me handle this...
  bounty_hunter+str_mark_self_depressed_1: "(grinds teeth) Stop wasting my time..."
  bounty_hunter+str_mark_self_irrational_0: "(snarling like a dog)"
  bounty_hunter+str_mark_self_irrational_1: I WILL EAT YOUR CORPSE!
  bounty_hunter+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: C'mere! Try your luck!
  bounty_hunter+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Yoo hoo. Over here. (snarl)
  bounty_hunter+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: Grim visions... But they are mere
    tricks.
  bounty_hunter+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: Brace yourselves! Stand your
    ground!
  bounty_hunter+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: Unearthly cold!
  bounty_hunter+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: "...hm."
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_abusive_0: Amateurs, observe!
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_abusive_1: This is no time for greenhorns!
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_depressed_0: What does it matter? We've lost.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_depressed_1: Bah. Your strategy is a failure.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_depressed_2: "(growl) I told you... It is pointless."
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_irrational_0: Pitter-patter, pitter-patter...
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_irrational_2: Where'd the bastard go!? Here kitty-kitty-kitty...
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_masochistic_0: "(shrug) Odd scar won't hurt my
    profits."
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Let's make this interesting...
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_masochistic_2: I expect your best, fool.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I prefer to keep them guessing.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_paranoid_1: These ones are sly - I must improvise!
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_paranoid_2: They're just waiting for us to slip
    up.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_selfish_0: Sod off. You don't command me.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_selfish_1: And let you pilfer my take? (snort)...
    Never.
  bounty_hunter+str_random_command_selfish_2: I have this in hand. Go.
  bounty_hunter+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: Keep yourselves together. T'aint
    so bad.
  bounty_hunter+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Take heart, I have a plan!
  bounty_hunter+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: "(snort) Laughable, mate."
  bounty_hunter+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: I come prepared.  Always.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_courageous_0: Tis tough... Not tough enough.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_courageous_1: I go first.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_focused_0: I live for this.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_focused_1: Everything bleeds. You watch.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_powerful_0: RRRRAAAAAA!
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_powerful_1: MMMRRRRAAAAAAA!
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Been through worse.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Easier than I thought.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Feel good. Feel like killing.
  bounty_hunter+str_virtued_vigorous_1: Slaying time.
crusader:
  crusader+str_afflicted_abusive_0: Stand in my way and I will smite you down!
  crusader+str_afflicted_abusive_1: I could have done this alone! I SHOULD have!
  crusader+str_afflicted_abusive_2: You are ALL consigned to hell! ALL OF YOU!
  crusader+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Fester and die, heathens!
  crusader+str_afflicted_abusive_4: You sick, unholy vermin! You stain my honor!
  crusader+str_afflicted_depressed_0: Can so much death ever truly be justified?
  crusader+str_afflicted_depressed_1: How can I fight for truth when I betray all
    I love?
  crusader+str_afflicted_depressed_2: Why did I trade her for this life? She loved
    me...
  crusader+str_afflicted_fearful_0: Oh, justice has failed me!
  crusader+str_afflicted_fearful_1: I... thought death would be honorable...
  crusader+str_afflicted_fearful_2: Where is the white light? I see only blackness...
  crusader+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Why now, facing death, do I crave a different
    life?
  crusader+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Terrible! ... So terrible!
  crusader+str_afflicted_irrational_0: I hear the chirping of birds and the baying
    of donkeys!
  crusader+str_afflicted_irrational_1: I DEFY the Verses! Dance and love and drink
    for all!
  crusader+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Damned be the Light! My humours churn with
    lust!
  crusader+str_afflicted_irrational_3: I could eat off this blade! Its lustre is so
    pure!
  crusader+str_afflicted_irrational_4: I smell brimstone. Or is that hyacinth?
  crusader+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: I will bear any wound!
  crusader+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: The pain is my penitence!
  crusader+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: I'll not avert mine eyes. T'would offend my
    vows.
  crusader+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: The flesh doth test my will. It shall not
    break it!
  crusader+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: To the faithful, scars are but a memento!
  crusader+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Even my blade whispers of doom!
  crusader+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Stay where I can see you! I know your mind!
  crusader+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Silence! Demons whisper in the dark...
  crusader+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: This is a test of my faith! I sense it!
  crusader+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Persecutors! I live by the law of truth!
  crusader+str_afflicted_selfish_0: I claim this victory for the church!
  crusader+str_afflicted_selfish_1: I have sacrificed much... Now I shall claim all!
  crusader+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Count the gold again. I have tithes to pay.
  crusader+str_afflicted_selfish_3: Let me shoulder the gold. My aura will exorcise
    it.
  crusader+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: None but I has the blessing of the Light!
  crusader+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: Profanity! I will excise that black tongue!
  crusader+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: Demon! Foul creature from the pit!
  crusader+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: DAMN YOU TO THE BLACK!
  crusader+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: I shall extinguish your black profanity!
  crusader+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Your persecution has come to an end!
  crusader+str_attack_self_depressed_0: I give myself to the Light...
  crusader+str_attack_self_depressed_1: I judge myself... "not worthy."
  crusader+str_attack_self_irrational_0: Father! I defy all that you made me!
  crusader+str_attack_self_irrational_1: "(sobbing)"
  crusader+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: I... I must do as the Light commands...
  crusader+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Power through sacrifice!
  crusader+str_bark_deathsdoor: Is this to be my last battle?
  crusader+str_bark_encourage_0: Your strength honors the Light.
  crusader+str_bark_encourage_1: Sit straight! Dignity is thy greatest weapon!
  crusader+str_bark_encourage_2: You would have made a good soldier... in another
    life.
  crusader+str_bark_first_aid_0: Of course I know what I'm doing! I'm a soldier!
  crusader+str_bark_first_aid_1: Incidentally, if ye perish, I can perform last rites.
  crusader+str_bark_first_aid_2: You heal quickly. Praise the Light.
  crusader+str_bark_hobby_0: Shhh! I am praying!
  crusader+str_bark_hobby_1: Go away! I am reading my Versebook!
  crusader+str_bark_hobby_2: No, I'll not play dice with you! I am studying the Verses!
  crusader+str_bark_pep_talk_0: I've led more difficult charges than this.
  crusader+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Justice is on my side. No evil can stand against that.
  crusader+str_bark_pep_talk_2: One need merely avoid the shadows to stand in the
    Light.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: Without my sword, you'd all be dead already!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Must I do all the slaying myself?!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Woe that I alone brought a sword of adequate
    size!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_abusive_3: I am saddled with iniquitous cowards. For shame!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_abusive_4: You profane my holy works!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_abusive_5: Quiet! This is a battle, not some baseborn tavern!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Eyes down, you cowering sheep!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Quiet, sinners. Your low prattle disturbs
    my prayer.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Your foul talk is an affront to the Light.
    For shame.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: It is futile.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Tempt thyself with flesh and hell awaits
    ye.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: Yes, I married once. But she is dead
    now.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: The pagan hordes gather in the dark.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Stoke the fire. I trust not this creeping
    gloom.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: Shh! ... Just keep watch! That's your job!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: The duck pond was always frozen at that
    time of the year...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: Blast, this armour is heavy. I'll leave
    it behind.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Pardon me, but I am enamoured with your
    hair. Mmmm.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: I've always got more blood to bleed.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: Blessed Light, grant me martyrdom this
    day.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Blessed Light, let my blood sanctify
    this unholy place.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: What was that?  What did you say?
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Eat in silence! Even the shadows have
    ears.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Keep thy weapons at the ready. We are
    not alone here...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: I deserve more than all of you!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: If we return victorious, the church will
    reward me greatly.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: This gold is tainted. I will bear it for
    the party.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Wherefore is the guiding Light so dim?
  crusader+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: The darkness holds fast here. So strong...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: My mind cannot recall the Verses. We are forsaken.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_depressed_3: Forsooth -- even I am afflicted with doubt!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_depressed_4: My reverie is haunted by things unsaid, loves
    lost...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Light preserve us. The twilight deepens...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: So dark here. And so cold...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: Black as hate, this, the darkest of all nights.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_fearful_3: Wherefore does the Light fade?
  crusader+str_bark_stress_fearful_4: Beware -- the will wains in the gloaming.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: Clang clang, steel steel!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Take a turn around the maypole! LA-LA DEE-DEE
    DEE-DEE!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: I will fight any of you! I will fight you
    barehanded!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_irrational_3: MAY THE LIGHT RAVAGE YOUR SOUL ETERNALLY!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_irrational_4: Where is my war-steed? He was at my side
    moments ago!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Aye, die I shall! 'Twas for thus I was forged!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Good! Anoint the black earth with my sacred
    fluids!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Our deaths shall honor the conquest of this
    Evil!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_masochistic_3: Go on, fool! Drown in our blood!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_masochistic_4: Slay us all! It makes so little difference!
  crusader+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: This place reeks of evil...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Soft! Ruin beckons from the shadows.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: The silence warns of dark deeds a-brewing.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_paranoid_3: Light fades. The mission is benighted.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_paranoid_4: Beware the creeping gloom; not all will flee
    the Light.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Surely the Light has a grander purpose for me?
  crusader+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: That one is mine.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: I claim these souls for justice.
  crusader+str_bark_stress_selfish_3: Their hopeless flailing encroaches on my swing...
  crusader+str_bark_stress_selfish_4: You threaten my mission with your foolish antics!
  crusader+str_block_buff_depressed_0: I am not worthy of improvement.
  crusader+str_block_buff_depressed_1: And how would that improve our lot? HOW??!
  crusader+str_block_buff_depressed_2: No. Leave me to my regrets.
  crusader+str_block_buff_irrational_0: You're more afraid than I am!
  crusader+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Just... STOP TOUCHING ME!
  crusader+str_block_buff_irrational_2: TAKE YOUR LIGHT-FORSAKEN ARSE AND BEGONE!
  crusader+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: I embrace my own fate!
  crusader+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: Nay! I self-flagellated last eve! Vigorously!
  crusader+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Begone! Providence alone shall suffice!
  crusader+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: I will not submit to your pagan rituals!
  crusader+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: Keep thy folksy heresies to thyself!
  crusader+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: I'll not taint my soul with your... flimflammery!
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: No... The Light says I need to lose
    a few stone.
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: How can you eat at a time like this?
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Nay -- I must leave room for the souls
    of the unjust!
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: I thrive on Light alone!
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: I will feast only after victory.
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Nay. Hunger is next to holiness.
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: This food is unclean. I cannot risk
    my divine purity.
  crusader+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Look, it's all pink. Cook it properly.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: It profanes the Light to visit
    blessings upon you unworthy dogs!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: I suggest prayer instead...
    sinner.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: "(snort) Find a task worthy
    of the Light."
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: It's no good. The will lacks.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: The Light abandons me. It
    knows I will fail.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: A desperate soul is an undisciplined
    soul...
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: I cannot. The Light denies
    a disquieted soul.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: '"Anno domai vistu--" Hold,
    what was that sound?!'
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: They are upon us! We should
    move, not sit about!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: No one is worthy - we are
    all shadowed, the light hates us!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: It's too stuffy in here.
    Open a porthole.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Work the lash all you wish,
    Father! I defy you! (sob)
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Nay. A little adversity
    will but focus the mind.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: There is no substitute
    for penitence and prayer.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Commit thy soul first.
    Then I shall petition the Light.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: No... can't let the others
    see my holy rituals.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: I'll not produce my relics
    here! I may lose them!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: Absolutely not. The Verses
    forbid that.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: No. I will save my blessings
    for when I need them most.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: "... My blessings are for
    emergencies only."
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: That's unnecessary. Besides,
    this incense isn't cheap.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: You again, with your witchcraft!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: If you think I need you, you
    are sorely mistaken.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_2: You are not worthy of aiding
    me.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Do not interrupt me. I pray
    for salvation.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Go away! I must focus on my
    strength now!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_2: That will do me no good. Little
    will...
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: BEGONE! OR I WILL SMITE YOU
    DOWN!
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: These scars are on the inside...
    and much too old...
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_2: I... I want only one thing,
    and it is forbidden.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Shields are for those who
    fear death.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: There is no shame in hardship.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_2: No... evil must have its
    fair trial.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: I will be censured if I accept
    that sort of charity.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: I must rely on myself now. The
    Light is ever-watchful.
  crusader+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_2: This is a trial. I will not
    disappoint the Light.
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: One more failure, and I'll be excommunicated.
    We stay.
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: Forsaking the Light will only ensure
    our doom.
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: No one shall survive!
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: You will fall! ALL WILL FALL!
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: To glory and to ruin!
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Light preserve my soul, for my
    body shall be broken!
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: I knew it! You profane word of justice!
  crusader+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: What?! Why would you seek to undo
    my good works?
  crusader+str_block_heal_depressed_0: I am not worthy of aid
  crusader+str_block_heal_depressed_1: Saving me is a sin. The helpless profane the
    Light.
  crusader+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Leave me alone. The others need aid more than
    I.
  crusader+str_block_heal_irrational_0: My life is a wound upon the world.
  crusader+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Leave me be! I am not even wounded!
  crusader+str_block_heal_irrational_2: Did you wash your hands? DID YOU WASH YOUR
    HANDS!!??
  crusader+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: No! The Light commands my pain!
  crusader+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: Save your sympathy. This pain is a gift.
  crusader+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: Nay. The sight of blood enrages my spirit.
    Leave it.
  crusader+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Don't touch me, sorcerer!
  crusader+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: No! Your ministrations will weaken my spirit!
  crusader+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: You are mad! Those bandages are filthy!
  crusader+str_block_item_depressed_0: I cannot accept your mercy. Just go...
  crusader+str_block_item_depressed_1: If I die from this, it is the Light's judgment.
  crusader+str_block_item_irrational_0: NO! No, Father, no! Leave me beeeee!
  crusader+str_block_item_irrational_1: And that's why I joined the order. Now, fetch
    me a goose.
  crusader+str_block_item_masochistic_0: No! I shall endure my punishment!
  crusader+str_block_item_masochistic_1: No. Pain and humiliation made me what I am.
  crusader+str_block_item_paranoid_0: You shall not befoul my sacred body!
  crusader+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Ha! Your parlor tricks shan't distract me! ONWARD!
  crusader+str_block_move_abusive_0: No. And if thou breaks rank again, I will smite
    thee.
  crusader+str_block_move_abusive_1: Stop stamping about! It does not become a warrior!
  crusader+str_block_move_fearful_0: So dark... so black...
  crusader+str_block_move_fearful_1: No! I must fight, here, now, or die!
  crusader+str_block_move_irrational_0: In rising black, debuts the bacchanal... here
    all shall perish.
  crusader+str_block_move_irrational_1: Immodesty and song... All herald the return
    of night.
  crusader+str_block_move_masochistic_0: I am made of the Light. And it shall restore
    me...
  crusader+str_block_move_masochistic_1: If my death is the only solution, then bring
    it on!
  crusader+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Methinks not. Stand tall, you coward.
  crusader+str_block_move_paranoid_1: You chose your path. I'll not help you flee
    it.
  crusader+str_buff_party_powerful_0: GLORY AND HONOR! Ever thus to the brave, my
    friends!
  crusader+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Light bless you all!
  crusader+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: I dub thee Soldier of the Light!
  crusader+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Go forth, friend! TO VICTORY!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I'm not the man I thought I was.
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: As the candle that burns too bright, I
    melt away...
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: I am no champion. I profane the field
    of battle.
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_depressed_3: This formation is weak. Surely we shall
    perish.
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_depressed_4: And lo, the twilight claims the sun once
    more...
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: W-we must fall back! We cannot hold the
    line!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: WITHDRAW! I am beset!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Back! BAAACK!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_fearful_3: Yield! Yield, ye bastards!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_fearful_4: We must away! They drive out the Light!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_fearful_5: I-I am not retreating! This is a counter-advance!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: There is blackness here! Cannot let it
    touch me!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: You seek to corrupt me! You shall NOT!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: Shadows in the black! They sense my power!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: I've done enough for you, fools.
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: You will have need of my strength later.
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Ah... a much better position. Carry on!
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_selfish_3: Hold! My armour has a scratch! ... Bugger.
  crusader+str_change_pos_back_selfish_4: "'Tis enough for now. Here -- you take over."
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: It matters not...
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Take me now. I have already sacrificed
    so much...
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Come then. Commit my soul to the holy Flame.
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_3: There is nothing for it. Redeem me, villain.
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_4: I shall be the finest martyr this world
    has e'er known.
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Where are you now General?! Have I no
    orders?
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: HOLD! My britches have torn! I must mend
    them!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: SQUIRE! SQUIIIRE! Where is that blasted
    lob-lolly?
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_3: I will learn my Verses, Father! Not the
    whip! PLEASE!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_4: Fetch me cheese and cider. There's a good
    lad.
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: I am invincible!  I am anointed by the
    Light!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: I shall fire my heart upon thee if I
    must!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: I shall be the finest martyr this world
    has e'er known!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_3: I sacrifice myself unto the Light! DO
    THY WORST!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_4: Work thy butchery upon me, foe... I am
    not afraid!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Mine!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Make way! This one suffers by my hand alone!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: This cretinous aberration begs me for redemption!
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_3: I will judge. You needn't concern yourselves.
  crusader+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_4: Step back! I alone may commit their souls
    to the grave!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: The faithless have no right to harm
    anyone...
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: Pathetic. You lack the will of the
    Light...
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: LIGHT! BLESS MY ALLIES THAT THEY
    MAY STOP FOOLING AROUND!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: "(incoherent babbling)"
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Aye yes... Just take all the glory,
    then.
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: STOP! That one belongs to the Light!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: A curse upon you! The Light is
    displeased!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Blasphemy! Your weakness offends
    the Light!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: Light in heaven... What are we
    to do?
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: The enemy is too strong! We must
    flee!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: I JUDGE THEE MENTALLY INCOMPETENT!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: I denounce you! Fall before
    me and beg forgiveness!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: How did you miss?! Unless...
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You shall be judged for your
    failure...
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: I knew it! The Light is saving
    that one for redemption!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: Move aside! If you cannot prevail,
    then the Light shall!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: Fool! Stop getting in the way of the soldiers!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: Good, let them kill you. Frees up some
    swinging space.
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: We are too weak.... pathetic in the eyes
    of the divine...
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: It will kill us! We are doomed!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Who threw that? Mock my allies and you
    mock me, kind sir!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: NOO! He is just a child! He didn't do
    anything wrong!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Yes... Let yourself be punished. The
    Light wills it.
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Mmm... Your cries of pain are like
    angel-song to my ears.
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: The Light forsakes us? But why??
  crusader+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: The final judgment is soon upon us, I
    fear...
  crusader+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: Gods, no! You've left us open!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: As it is spoken, we shall all soon perish
    in darkness.
  crusader+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: BY THE LIGHT, I SHALL... I shall...
    Oh, sod it.
  crusader+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: MAY THE LIGHT BURN YOUR FLESH, FOOL!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: You cannot trick me! You conspire with
    them!
  crusader+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: Ha! You cannot hide this deception
    from the Light!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: HAAAGH! You Lightless fiend! Leave us be!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: AAAGH!... No... NO! We must away! It is
    too powerful!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: FALL TO THE LIGHT, HEATHEN!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Father!... FATHER! I HEAR YOU!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: That one was for the Light.
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: This persecution only strengthens my
    devotion!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: The darkness sent them! They are emissaries
    of death!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: There must be more of them! They're just
    softening us up!
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: If I die, I am owed last rites. Don't forget.
  crusader+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Ungh!  I deserve worse!
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Light, protect me!
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: No! I am too young to be judged yet!
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: Yes, your eminence. Blood and bread,
    as you command.
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: No, no! Swing higher, and harder!
    There's a good lad.
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Show your worth! Spill my holy blood!
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Wretched fool! I judge you weak!
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: These ones hate the Light!
  crusader+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: Why are they attacking me? What have
    you done?!
  crusader+str_critbyhero_0: A righteous blow!
  crusader+str_critbyhero_1: Truth prevails!
  crusader+str_critbyhero_2: Crushed by justice!
  crusader+str_critbyhero_3: Thou art judged!
  crusader+str_critbyhero_4: I judge thee guilty!
  crusader+str_critbyhero_5: I banish thee!
  crusader+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: The power of the Light flows through me...
  crusader+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: I am a ray of the Light... warm, bright, indomitable.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: I am but a man... and no more.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: Such an action betrays justice itself...
  crusader+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: The blackness looms... like a mountain
    of dread.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_depressed_3: My will is weak. The fight has drained
    me...
  crusader+str_ignore_command_depressed_4: That way lies failure -- this I know.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_depressed_5: My wasted life -- measured in steel and
    blood...
  crusader+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: No...noooooo!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: Soft! The time isn't yet right!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: "... Why do I hesitate!? Disgraceful!"
  crusader+str_ignore_command_fearful_3: Not yet... N-not yet!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_fearful_4: Hold a moment! The enemy knows my mind!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Buff the pommel, boy! When it strikes,
    it must impress!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Where is my Versebook? In the outhouse
    again!? Fie!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: What, no peas? What sort of banquet is
    this?
  crusader+str_ignore_command_irrational_3: Summon the chirurgeon. My verrucas need
    paring.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_irrational_4: Not now. I'm praying.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: I cannot, I will not!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: The enemy is no fool! I could be walking
    into a trap!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: No... that's exactly what the darkness wants!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_paranoid_3: The Light is watching, and it disapproves.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_paranoid_4: I will not. Not while their eyes are upon
    me.
  crusader+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I fight on my own terms!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: The Light does not will it!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: That would leave me vulnerable!
  crusader+str_ignore_command_selfish_3: I will not expose myself like that! What
    game is this?
  crusader+str_ignore_command_selfish_4: No... my only chance is to hold fast.
  crusader+str_mark_self_depressed_0: I will not endure another day in this world
    of darkness!
  crusader+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Send me to the Light! I beg for absolution!
  crusader+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Eternal suffering in the black hells for you!
    ETERNAL!
  crusader+str_mark_self_irrational_1: I CONSIGN YOU TO HELL.
  crusader+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: My blood will be your judge! Spill it, and
    be damned!
  crusader+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: My body is a shield against your misdeeds!
  crusader+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: I see... I see an old man, alone on his
    death bed!
  crusader+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: It wields evil like fire!
  crusader+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Unholy foulness! I will take
    you with me!
  crusader+str_random_command_abusive_0: Suffer not the faithless!
  crusader+str_random_command_abusive_1: Naught but contempt for the mewling, faithless
    masses!
  crusader+str_random_command_abusive_2: That is foolishness! The Light defies you!
  crusader+str_random_command_abusive_3: Your recklessness will be my ruin!
  crusader+str_random_command_abusive_4: You are not trained in tactics. That much
    is certain.
  crusader+str_random_command_depressed_0: My discipline fades. I am carried along
    by hate and whim.
  crusader+str_random_command_depressed_1: Nothing matters now. The Light is extinguished...
  crusader+str_random_command_depressed_2: Will alone cannot slow the setting sun,
    so why try?
  crusader+str_random_command_depressed_3: All I have left is hate. Let it be my guide.
  crusader+str_random_command_depressed_4: It is too late. No battle tactic can save
    us now.
  crusader+str_random_command_irrational_0: Dust clings to the blade as easily as
    blood!
  crusader+str_random_command_irrational_1: Ungh... My mind reels. What devil embraces
    me?
  crusader+str_random_command_irrational_2: A shining star... streaking through the
    aether...
  crusader+str_random_command_irrational_3: How can the blackness glow? And yet...
    it RADIATES!
  crusader+str_random_command_irrational_4: My sword guides itself! Driven by no mortal
    soul!
  crusader+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Give me pain!
  crusader+str_random_command_masochistic_1: I risk all to pronounce thy judgment!
  crusader+str_random_command_masochistic_2: Stand aside! If harm is inevitable, let
    it come to me!
  crusader+str_random_command_masochistic_3: Blood may run, but faith never falters!
  crusader+str_random_command_masochistic_4: I act on faith alone, come what may!
  crusader+str_random_command_masochistic_5: I have the moral highground! Do what
    thou will!
  crusader+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I heard you talking about me!
  crusader+str_random_command_paranoid_1: These foes' minds are sharp. Must keep them
    guessing.
  crusader+str_random_command_paranoid_2: No... I trust the Light alone to illuminate
    my path.
  crusader+str_random_command_paranoid_3: Like this!... Yes, the shadows cannot see
    us now!
  crusader+str_random_command_paranoid_4: I do not take orders from trickster devils!
  crusader+str_random_command_paranoid_5: Your words are poison... I choose otherwise.
  crusader+str_random_command_selfish_0: My sword preserves me, and I honor its gifts.
  crusader+str_random_command_selfish_1: Nay -- the Light demands otherwise!
  crusader+str_random_command_selfish_2: My blade thirsts for blood. None shall deny
    it.
  crusader+str_random_command_selfish_3: I judge otherwise. Such is my divine prerogative.
  crusader+str_random_command_selfish_4: Assign your busy-work elsewhere. I am a weapon
    of law.
  crusader+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: Courage, men. We shall prevail.
  crusader+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: You will survive. I judge it so.
  crusader+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: Light, grant me your strength!
  crusader+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: I have been judged worthy!
  crusader+str_virtued_courageous_0: Rally to me, friends!
  crusader+str_virtued_courageous_1: OOONWAAARD!
  crusader+str_virtued_courageous_2: Nothing can extinguish the Light!
  crusader+str_virtued_courageous_3: Light be our vanguard!
  crusader+str_virtued_courageous_4: CHAAAARGE!
  crusader+str_virtued_focused_0: Light, guide my sword!
  crusader+str_virtued_focused_1: Light grace my strikes! Turn away the blackness!
  crusader+str_virtued_focused_2: Justice and honor guide my hand.
  crusader+str_virtued_focused_3: The holy Light is relentless... as am I.
  crusader+str_virtued_focused_4: Born of rage -- destined for triumph!
  crusader+str_virtued_powerful_1: I am consumed in holy Light!
  crusader+str_virtued_powerful_2: Now you shall know how bright the Light!
  crusader+str_virtued_powerful_3: Stoke the bonfire and tie the noose -- justice
    is nigh.
  crusader+str_virtued_powerful_4: The trumpeter sounds the call! Great deeds arise!
  crusader+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Stand aside! Let the Light in!
  crusader+str_virtued_stalwart_2: I am armoured in more than just steel, blasphemers!
  crusader+str_virtued_stalwart_3: The soul is resourceful. It will stand.
  crusader+str_virtued_stalwart_4: I turn their evil like an arrow from my blade.
  crusader+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Overwhelming faith!
  crusader+str_virtued_vigorous_1: Light seize me! Make me your instrument!
  crusader+str_virtued_vigorous_2: My every step sanctifies this unholy earth!
  crusader+str_virtued_vigorous_3: The Light incarnate!
  crusader+str_virtued_vigorous_4: I am purified!
grave_robber:
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_abusive_0: Stand away from me, you beggars!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_abusive_1: My allies' dank musk will disguise me well.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_abusive_2: None of you beslubbering dewberries can be
    trusted...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Pray tell how I ended up out here with these
    half-wits?
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_abusive_4: You lot render me positively queenly. I approve.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_depressed_0: Curse this life. Still, 'tis my own doing...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Seems I've been sentenced to dawdle with
    oafish cut-purses.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_depressed_2: I was a Lady once. Now, little more than
    a burglar.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_depressed_3: Blazes. Imagine if I'd been content with
    what I had...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_depressed_4: '"A bird in the hand," the judge said. Sigh.'
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_fearful_0: I must away! These morbid paths curdle my
    blood!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_fearful_1: Curses! A blacker fate I dare not imagine!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_fearful_2: My mind conjures the baying of wolves! What
    horrors!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_fearful_3: This place suffers not folk as fair as myself!
    Away, away!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Not but once have I stood in fear as nakedly
    as this!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_irrational_0: Off with my head!  A capital idea!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_irrational_1: So many young gentlemen, so little propriety.
    Sigh.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_irrational_2: I become like the earth! Claiming all!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_irrational_3: There is a woman in my coat! Out, out,
    you vagabond!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Pass the teacakes my dear. There's a lass.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Come, foul denizens of the night! Do your
    worst!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: There's no wound a half-gallon of absinthe
    won't cure.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: What's a bruise or two, in the face of
    such plunder?
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Pshaw! I know a lovely doctor who owes
    me a favour...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: You cannot harm one whom society has left
    for dead...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Twenty-five percent, says I. You will sell
    me no dog!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: I sense the flick of a viper's tongue. Beware
    of treachery...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Their eyes shift about. I daresay a trick
    is afoot...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Betrayal... I must cast a keen eye over my
    shoulder...
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: I assure you, the worst is far from over.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Best let me appraise the loot. I have an eye
    for jewels!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_selfish_1: These hook-fingered brutes are fleecing me,
    I know it.
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Twenty-five percent... laughable! I am worth
    a fortune!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_selfish_3: I am no child slave. I deserve a Lady's recompense!
  grave_robber+str_afflicted_selfish_4: What an attractive bauble... Mine!
  grave_robber+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: You simpering cockerel. I've about had
    it with you!
  grave_robber+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: En garde! You shall assault my senses
    no longer!
  grave_robber+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: You were there! You were at my trial!
    BASTARD!
  grave_robber+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: It was you! You ruined my life! HRRAAAA!
  grave_robber+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: I've seen you eyeing my things! Have
    at thee!
  grave_robber+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Kill or be killed. 'Tis a hard lesson,
    to be sure!
  grave_robber+str_attack_self_depressed_0: A nick here, a nick there... soon the
    misery must end.
  grave_robber+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Suicide, yes... A most romantic death.
  grave_robber+str_attack_self_irrational_0: I see my name on the door! A mausoleum!
    MY MAUSOLEUM!
  grave_robber+str_attack_self_irrational_1: I am the Reaper. All shall fall.
  grave_robber+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: Pain? Pfff.
  grave_robber+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Here - I will help you along. ... There!
  grave_robber+str_bark_deathsdoor: If I fall...don't put me in the ground.
  grave_robber+str_bark_encourage_0: It pains me to say, but I find your skills...
    adequate.
  grave_robber+str_bark_encourage_1: Lordy me, but aren't you well-proportioned!
  grave_robber+str_bark_encourage_2: Chin up, deary. Your fashion sense alone could
    fell an army.
  grave_robber+str_bark_first_aid_0: Lucky thing for you I have dabbled in crochet!
  grave_robber+str_bark_first_aid_1: There, all patched up. That'll be five pence.
  grave_robber+str_bark_first_aid_2: If you perchance to snuff it, may I have your
    ring?
  grave_robber+str_bark_hobby_0: You -- idle one! Hold my yarn!
  grave_robber+str_bark_hobby_1: Yes, I carve tiny tombstones. Mementos of my exploits.
  grave_robber+str_bark_hobby_2: These stab holes will simply not do!  Where's my
    needle and thread?
  grave_robber+str_bark_pep_talk_0: Think of the treasure, sweethearts! All gleam
    and gold!
  grave_robber+str_bark_pep_talk_1: It's just another graveyard. I've plundered hundreds.
  grave_robber+str_bark_pep_talk_2: You all look a fright. Pat yourselves down...
    Better.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: No need for a weapon beyond that fetid rank!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: You reek like a mortician's refuse. Feh!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: So hideous... you wound my eyes!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Sleep here? With you ill-bred canker-blossoms?
    Ha!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: If you malt-worms disturb my sleep,
    you'll regret it.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Tsk. What next? Shall I LITERALLY sleep
    with dogs?
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: Bah. I've lost more money than you
    can dream of.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: There are no friends here. Keep to
    yourselves.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: So cold here. Like... like a mausoleum.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: I have a feeling I'll ne'er wake again...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: I cannot sleep for the sounds of this
    place.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: DRAW! ... Over there, I... swear I
    saw something...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Here's a pretty fellow! All lace
    and taffeta! Oh bravo!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: I see... I see a face in the fire...
    YOUR FACE.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Let us play a game... I call it
    Whisky and Stabscotch.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Anyone care for a round of stabscotch?
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: I volunteer for the watch.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Sleep? And miss the surprise attack?
    Lordy, no!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: I will be keeping a knife under my
    pillow tonight.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: This place is death. Only a fool would
    close his eyes.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Something stalks us. I sense its musky
    rank...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Let me appraise the party loot. Come,
    hand it over.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: If you wanted sherry, you might have
    brought your own.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: You clear the next section. My body
    cries for repose.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: And now we die... entombed in our greed.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: A sad end to a life full of promise and
    grace.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: From the loftiest heights to the blackest
    deeps...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: We should not tarry... Villainy is on the
    take.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: Cans't thou hear it? The low screeching
    on the wind?
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: My skin prickles something fierce...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: Bring me my needles! These wounds must
    be stitched!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: A stone vault with names... all in a
    peaceful rest...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: The lock is broken, the casket unsealed...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Ha! Another mark won't tarnish this
    soul!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Yes, work away! Gives my chirurgeon
    something to do!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Do as you like. You'll not deter me
    from my share.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: We have fallen prey to dark deeds and machinations.
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: A foul trick it was, luring me here...
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: They must have known we were coming!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Damn and blast! They've bled on my coat
    YET AGAIN!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: How did I get hornswoggled into this malarkey?
    Bah!
  grave_robber+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: I'm looking out for me, and my coinpurse.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_depressed_0: No... I turned my back on luxuries long
    ago.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_depressed_1: I have stolen so much... how could I deserve
    more?
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_depressed_2: Your kindness serves only to to fuel my
    self-pity.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Thief! Heretic!!! DEFILER!!!
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_irrational_1: What did you do?? You took something!!
    GIVE IT BACK!!!
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_irrational_2: Never touch me, you snark-jawed harlot!
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: Thank you, but no. I fancy a hearty walloping.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: I prefer my disadvantage, thank you.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Thank you, but a flash of hot blood keeps
    me limber.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Now now, that's enough with the friendly
    touching.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: No, thank you. I don't like that glint in
    your eye.
  grave_robber+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: Keep your greasy fingers to yourself, thank
    you.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: Nothing at the moment, thank you.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Ugh.. I cannot eat. I need some
    time to myself.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: I'll not give the maggots a good
    meal, no sir.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: Goodness no! I ate yesterday!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: No thank you. I keep a light
    stomach while on the take.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Thin blood keeps the hands quick.
    Thus I decline.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: This is... are you trying to murder
    me?
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Surely, this is the laziest poisoning
    attempt of all time.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Oh, little suckling piggy,
    go find your hog-mother.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Outrageous!  The Lady
    of the house tends not to the ills of her servants!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Your company wears on
    me. I'd rather part with it.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: I have come down so
    far in the world, what use am I?
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: What can I do, save
    break my nails clawing for paltry riches?
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Ha. You'll find more
    compassion in a corpse, deary.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: Staying here is madness.
    I cannot countenance it.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: We should move on! They
    are still far too close!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: Please... let us rest
    quickly and get a move on.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: Needle-point is quite
    a challenge, I must say!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: And I shall be attending
    the soiree clad in pearls and wonderous finery!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Excuse me?! I'm reading!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: I'd prefer to let
    the pain linger.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Oh brace up!  We'll
    be fine...
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Bless me, but there's
    a lot of whining on this trip.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: What foolishness! We
    should leave this place NOW!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Oh yes... you would like
    that, wouldn't you?
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: You're just trying to
    get at my purse. Shoo!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: Not until I get some promise
    of bonus pay.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: That wasn't in my contract.
    But we could renegotiate...
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: I will, I will... for
    an extra five percent.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Salacious pig - if you seek
    some closeness, try the cabaret!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: Surely you jest!  I am a
    Lady, approach me not!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Hope is little more than
    salt in my tea.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: "... You are kind, but...
    you waste your efforts."
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: Hehehe Lady Mary was always
    a little too loquacious, it's true.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: Send for the undertaker!
    I am dead and mouldering!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: I shall bleed enough
    to cover my coat in crimson!
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: I find the pain quite...satisfying,
    thank you.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: Keep a respectful distance.
    I am still a Lady in some ways.
  grave_robber+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: Shh! I heard something!
    Stay at the ready!
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: No. My bed is made entirely of
    humiliation. Not one more.
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: Let me die with A SHRED of dignity,
    at least.
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: No matter where we flee, the
    noose awaits...
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: I am the undertaker. I am death's
    apologist.
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Why? All these scars will look
    positively delightful!
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: What? I was just starting to
    enjoy it!
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: And take the booty for yourself?
    Dear me, no.
  grave_robber+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: You cowardly dogfish! You KNEW
    this would happen!
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_depressed_0: No. I escaped the gallows once -- never
    again.
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_depressed_1: My virtue is already marred. No healing
    can cure that.
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Why offer respite?  For your mocking amusement?
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_irrational_0: Oh look, Janey! An invitation to the ball!
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_irrational_1: What lovely lace gloves? Surely the finest
    in town!
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_irrational_2: Couldn't possibly! I'm on my way to the
    opera!
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Why blunt the sting? It's kept me going
    thus far.
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: I love a little punishment; it suits
    me, like a fine coat.
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: You lack faith in me? Oh... how disheartening.
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: I very highly doubt your intentions, my
    good fellow!
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: Thank you, but no. I have my reasons.
  grave_robber+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Keep your silly incantations to yourself,
    please.
  grave_robber+str_block_item_depressed_0: No, no, please... Just leave me to a spinster's
    fate!
  grave_robber+str_block_item_depressed_1: You lovely fool. Can't you see it's too
    late?
  grave_robber+str_block_item_irrational_0: HYAH! HYAH! Ride like the wind, my little
    horsey!
  grave_robber+str_block_item_irrational_1: Do you like the needlework? I did it myself.
  grave_robber+str_block_item_masochistic_0: Oh, that? I've weathered worse.
  grave_robber+str_block_item_masochistic_1: T'is but a pin prick, deary! Go bother
    the others!
  grave_robber+str_block_item_paranoid_0: I don't need anything you have.
  grave_robber+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Stop touching me! For Heaven's sake!
  grave_robber+str_block_move_abusive_0: You fidget more than a child at mass. Honestly!
  grave_robber+str_block_move_abusive_1: Oh, calm yourself - a lady is not to be brushed
    aside!
  grave_robber+str_block_move_fearful_0: You amaze me, friend. Surely you know we
    must die.
  grave_robber+str_block_move_fearful_1: Move!? Hells-bells, I canst hardly breathe!
  grave_robber+str_block_move_irrational_0: "(humming a waltz and ignoring you)"
  grave_robber+str_block_move_irrational_1: Deary, the sailors hover about you like
    moths on a lantern!
  grave_robber+str_block_move_masochistic_0: I rather like it here. Grand view of
    the devastation.
  grave_robber+str_block_move_masochistic_1: No thank you. I think it's high-time
    I earned my keep.
  grave_robber+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Mmm... l like not the look in your eye.
    I decline.
  grave_robber+str_block_move_paranoid_1: What, so you can slip away more easily?
    Ha!
  grave_robber+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Get us home, and I'll share out some of
    my filthy lucre.
  grave_robber+str_buff_party_powerful_1: You've seen how I do it, now you try!
  grave_robber+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Look at you, all heroic. (wink)
  grave_robber+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Seems you've caught the gist
    of it. Fancy that!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: What am I doing out here? I should
    have done more with my life.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: There is no purpose to this. We must
    surrender!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: I've fought long enough, and to what
    end?
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: I've had more than my fill of this madness!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Enough! I cannot stand their dreadful
    gaze!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Too powerful! FAR too powerful!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: Heavens! They have come for me!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: Do you see their eyes! There is something
    EVIL within!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: We must away! Before their compatriots
    arrive!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Far too messy for a lady like myself.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Honestly, I prefer the looting over
    the killing.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Dear me... All this gore is playing
    hell on my skin.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: There is no compensation for what I've
    lost...
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Take me then. I know the grave better
    than most.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Take me, then. Lord knows I've taken
    plenty of you.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: I do indeed fancy a dance, thank ye!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: No second chance at life... only a
    second death.
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: My fortune for a fence who trades
    souls for lucre...
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Here's a worthy fellow! En garde!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Indeed, every prick takes away the
    sting!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: I do rather like to be seen. (wink)
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: This pretty creep is all mine!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: You're fouling up my aim, you clay-brained
    manikin!
  grave_robber+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: The coin-purse on that one is positively
    bulging...
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Good, but try aiming next time.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: Lovely. Now if only you could
    master the art of bathing.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Oh, lovely! Yes, the pink
    silk one. Beautiful!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Oh my! A party? For me?!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Honestly, how am I to earn a
    bonus with you around?
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Stop making it look so easy!
    Must keep our fees high...
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Honestly, fish in a barrel
    have nothing to fear from you.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: My cat could put up a better
    fight. And he's dead.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: You see?! They are powerful
    beyond measure!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: What madness brought us here?!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: Such lovely doilies. Do
    they come in blood red??
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: And miss the grand ball?
    I THINK NOT.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Oh, just come out with it!
    They paid you to miss!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You can not deceive me,
    you wretch. You have betrayed us!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Good. I wanted that one for
    myself as is.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: If I kill it, do I get the
    pick of his loot?
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: Oh, lord, what a sham you are! Honestly!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: Is that your signature move then? (titter
    titter)
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Please... let us away! I see our deaths!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: I am too young to have my name etched
    in stone... (shudder)
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Now now, you two. No rough-housing
    in the solarium.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: SHHHH! This is a library!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: "(soft moan) A little blood looks
    good on you, I must say."
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Ooo, me next!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: It is as though they know our every
    move...
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: I do not like this! They are too powerful!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: And here we are... The white light
    at the end of the tunnel.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: That's it! We've breathed our last,
    friends!
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Darling, fetch the good napkins.
    Thank you, dear.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Oh, bother. I've gone and bust
    me seam.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: You are working together... You
    alone will survive.
  grave_robber+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: You can not deceive me, wretch.
    You have betrayed us!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: GAH! ... Why do we linger?? You merciless
    fools!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: No! No more, please! Have pity!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: Oh bother. You've positively ruined
    the carpet.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: What a bloody mess you've made.
    Andrea, fetch the maid.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: MMMmmmm. Hurts so good.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: You hit hard. I rather like that!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: Ungh! It's the food! They can smell
    it from a mile off!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: You bastards! You're TRYING to stain
    my coat, aren't you?
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Bloody hell! More holes to sew up!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Hey! Pick on someone your own... social
    class!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: "(terrified scream)"
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: That one's out for blood! MY BLOOD!
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: Hmm? Oh, nothing for me, thank
    you.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Breezy out today, isn't it?
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: You can do better, deary. Come
    now.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Aaaaw... I was looking forward
    to that one.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: Oh blast. I've gone and riled that
    one.
  grave_robber+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: Why attack me?! How have I offended
    thee?!
  grave_robber+str_critbyhero_0: Pardon my reach!
  grave_robber+str_critbyhero_1: Oh, did that sting?
  grave_robber+str_critbyhero_2: Grr! You've bled on my best coat!
  grave_robber+str_critbyhero_3: Think I'm done with you? HARDLY!
  grave_robber+str_critbyhero_4: Just one piece at a time, sweet-thing!
  grave_robber+str_critbyhero_5: You're looking a tad wan, friend.
  grave_robber+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Hmm. Nothing to fuss about.
  grave_robber+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: "(sings a pleasant song)"
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: There is no sense in that. And I would
    know...
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: But why? Life owes me no favors.
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: I'll never buy my way out of this.
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Are you perfectly mad?! They'll kill
    me!
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: No... They are too savage!
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: "(gulp) I just... I just need to catch
    my wind."
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: My leather is lacy and my lace is
    tattered...
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: It's tea time, I say!
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: My hair is positively knotted!
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: Hah, I am no lamb, led to slaughter!
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I'm no society hag!
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: "... Foolishness!"
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I'm my own woman.
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: Yes, in a moment, in a moment... maybe.
  grave_robber+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: You know, we never did discuss my expenses....
  grave_robber+str_mark_self_depressed_0: Come! My pitiable life deserves a pitiable
    end!
  grave_robber+str_mark_self_depressed_1: I choose you! You will consign me to the
    grave! NOW!
  grave_robber+str_mark_self_irrational_0: I have decided we must all die. We start
    with you.
  grave_robber+str_mark_self_irrational_1: Darkness looms over you like a black vapour!
  grave_robber+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Cut me! I wish to look the part!
  grave_robber+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Foolish trifles! Is this all I can expect
    from you?
  grave_robber+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: One tomb too far... My final resting
    place?
  grave_robber+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: Agh! How dare you touch me!
  grave_robber+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: A proper lady does not
    volunteer herself for slaughter!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_abusive_0: Pigs!  Fools!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_abusive_1: Let the expert handle this!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_abusive_2: Psh, enough idle chatter!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_depressed_0: Surely you see there's no point to
    all this?
  grave_robber+str_random_command_depressed_1: Hush now, sweet-cheeks. There's nothing
    more to do.
  grave_robber+str_random_command_depressed_2: "(chuckle) You foolish child. We are
    already dead."
  grave_robber+str_random_command_irrational_0: I am swallowed by the black earth!
    I see nothing!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_irrational_1: Flakes of gold and a smudge of rose...
  grave_robber+str_random_command_irrational_2: Ambergris, Lily of The Valley, and
    smoldering oak...
  grave_robber+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Dance with me, dear!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_masochistic_1: No, my sweet -- I rather like a little
    bloodying...
  grave_robber+str_random_command_masochistic_2: What? Afraid of a little blood?
  grave_robber+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I can feel a twisted gaze?  Which of
    you snickered?!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Who's that watching me?!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Balderdash. I will not be deceived!
  grave_robber+str_random_command_selfish_0: Tsk. Let me make a decision for once.
  grave_robber+str_random_command_selfish_1: And just when did I become your personal
    servant?
  grave_robber+str_random_command_selfish_2: I do otherwise. Dost thou object...?
  grave_robber+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: Calm thyself. We'll be home for
    teatime, I am certain.
  grave_robber+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Oh, relax, this is but a trifling
    matter...
  grave_robber+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: Well now... I feel positively radiant!
  grave_robber+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: "(defiant laughter)"
  grave_robber+str_virtued_courageous_0: Bless me, this is going better than I thought.
  grave_robber+str_virtued_courageous_1: Just stay focused on the prize. Stay focused...
  grave_robber+str_virtued_focused_0: Aim for the eyes. They'll ne'er see it coming.
  grave_robber+str_virtued_focused_1: Ponder not but the take. That's the job.
  grave_robber+str_virtued_powerful_0: Enough lolly-gagging. Now I aim for the heart.
  grave_robber+str_virtued_powerful_1: A knife to the heart, t'other for the coinpurse.
  grave_robber+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Pshaw. 'Tis little more than a children's funhouse!
  grave_robber+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Smoke and mirrors, my fellows. Little more!
  grave_robber+str_virtued_vigorous_0: A little bravery beats laudanum any day, apparently.
  grave_robber+str_virtued_vigorous_1: I can take them on single-handed!
hellion:
  hellion+str_afflicted_abusive_0: City-folk... War is for warriors!
  hellion+str_afflicted_abusive_1: The civilized world is weak. Such a disappointment.
  hellion+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Not one of you knows battle like my people...
  hellion+str_afflicted_abusive_3: These others lack spirit. They will not survive...
  hellion+str_afflicted_abusive_4: They won't spar with me because they fear pain.
    Fools.
  hellion+str_afflicted_depressed_0: Where flies the warhawk? It abandons my soul...
  hellion+str_afflicted_depressed_1: My spirit longs for the open air I'll never breathe
    again.
  hellion+str_afflicted_depressed_2: There is no honor in these lands... It pains
    me.
  hellion+str_afflicted_depressed_3: The spirits all whisper of failure...
  hellion+str_afflicted_depressed_4: No! Do not ponder death! That way lies defeat...
  hellion+str_afflicted_fearful_0: No... I will not cower! I WILL NOT!
  hellion+str_afflicted_fearful_1: The elders did not warn me of this...
  hellion+str_afflicted_fearful_2: I...must... concentrate! I cannot be afraid!
  hellion+str_afflicted_fearful_3: It is not so cold. And yet I tremble...
  hellion+str_afflicted_fearful_4: You can do this... You were BORN for this!
  hellion+str_afflicted_irrational_0: Yessss... the blood bubbles at my lips! YYAAAAAASSS!
  hellion+str_afflicted_irrational_1: I am not whole until I am cut apart. DO IT!
  hellion+str_afflicted_irrational_2: I soar like the warhawk. High above the clouds...
  hellion+str_afflicted_irrational_3: Someone armwrestle me! ... COME ON, YOU COWARDS!
  hellion+str_afflicted_irrational_4: The wilding beasts go unclothed -- so shall
    I!
  hellion+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Nothing refreshes the spirit like one's own
    blood!
  hellion+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: These scars will prove my worth.
  hellion+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Bloody me! I crave it! KAH-LEEEEEE-YAAAAAA!
  hellion+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Carve away the fat 'til only a warrior remains!
  hellion+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Let them ply their dark trade. My soul is invincible.
  hellion+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: The spirits here are hungry. I feel their breath...
  hellion+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: My soul stands out like a flame. I am exposed...
  hellion+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Secretly, they covet my strength. Soon, they will
    show it.
  hellion+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Beasts stalk the edge. Can you smell their hate?
  hellion+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: They have the eyes of nervous tigers...
  hellion+str_afflicted_selfish_0: They steal my kill again, I'll collect on the debt.
  hellion+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Leave them to me! Leave them ALL to me!
  hellion+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Glory is wasted on them! I claim my due!
  hellion+str_afflicted_selfish_3: True, I am here for the glory. But a warrior must
    eat.
  hellion+str_afflicted_selfish_4: Whosoever bleeds the most ought to benefit the
    most...
  hellion+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: None but beast should walk this land. I will
    cleanse it!
  hellion+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: Ab'rokhan dahry cho'lem, you stinking rat!
  hellion+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: "(bizarre growling and hissing)"
  hellion+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: KAI-EEEEEEEE!
  hellion+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Never trust city folk!
  hellion+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: The ancestral spirits have warned me of
    your kind...
  hellion+str_attack_self_depressed_0: Perhaps there are worthier foes in the afterlife...
  hellion+str_attack_self_depressed_1: The world does not deserve my anger...
  hellion+str_attack_self_irrational_0: "(wild hissing)"
  hellion+str_attack_self_irrational_1: KAI-REEEEEEE!
  hellion+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: Heh, you see?... I LIKE to bleed!
  hellion+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: You cannot hurt me, you see? My will is unbreakable!
  hellion+str_bark_deathsdoor: A warrior's death awaits me!
  hellion+str_bark_encourage_0: The spirits bless you! Akh-lorga vshtar manokhr'an!
  hellion+str_bark_encourage_1: You have the heart of a panther. I can hear it purring...
  hellion+str_bark_encourage_2: Come, wrestle with me. It will lift your spirits.
  hellion+str_bark_first_aid_0: I have packed your wounds with dung. Feel better?
  hellion+str_bark_first_aid_1: The bones of the vanquished make excellent splints,
    aye?
  hellion+str_bark_first_aid_2: That's a bad cut. Let me lick it clean.
  hellion+str_bark_hobby_0: Bet none of you can throw a knife as well as I. Eh?
  hellion+str_bark_hobby_1: Wrestle me. I crave an easy victory. (grin)
  hellion+str_bark_hobby_2: I am learning to read. It is a rare skill among my kind.
  hellion+str_bark_pep_talk_0: Keep your weapons a'readied. This is rule number one.
  hellion+str_bark_pep_talk_1: I have sharpened our steels. We could skin a turtle.
  hellion+str_bark_pep_talk_2: We'll survive... if we submit to the beast inside.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: Cowards all! Run! Run to your den-mother's breast!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Gah! Where are the foes worthy of my rage!?
  hellion+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: This is no challenge! I long for honorable battle!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: I'll be slain by these fools' snoring, if
    anything.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Hear me, foes! Your foul stench shall be
    cleansed!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Which one to eat first when the food runs
    out? Hmmm...
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: I need fresh meat... not this pathetic
    dried nonsense.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: I feel cold. The ancestors' love not this
    place.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: The savanna calls to me, though its voice
    is weak.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: We are being hunted... (shudder)
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: So dark... E'en the ancestral sky-lights
    fail.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: My skin prickles... Something draws near.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: "(growling, howling, snarling)"
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: You have good legs. Lovely MEATY legs...
    (licks lips)
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: The sun rises! ... KAI-REEE, KAI-REEE,
    KAI-ROOOOOOOO!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Ehhh... There. One more scar to honor
    the elders.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: No more for me. Must save room for the
    fresh meat.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Sleep? Only when my foes lie dead in
    a heap.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: The spirits are offended by our trampings...
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: I like not these city-folk's wandering
    eyes...
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: The elders warned me of city-folk... Now
    I see why.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Let me go first next time. You move too
    slowly.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: If we're going to gamble, let's make it
    worth my time.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: I said that their teeth were mine. Hand
    them over.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: They are powerful... more powerful than I'd
    feared.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: I have trained endlessly, and yet... so tired...
  hellion+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: They have no fear... and yet I... I...
  hellion+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: What unnatural will guides them?!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: Their jaws drip with death!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: We are outmatched! There is no glory in slaughter!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: KREEEE-YAAAAA! Your heads on a pike! ALL OF
    YOU!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: BURN THEIR HUTS! EAT THEIR YOUNG! GRRRRAAAAAAA!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Throw them over the walls! Let them eat their
    dead!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: To face death is to know life.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Cut harder, cowards!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: If you spill my blood, you'll not doubt my
    resolve.
  hellion+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: I feel weak! Like as... like as I've been poisoned!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: They've caught our scent! More will join the
    pack!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: Someone sent them! One of your city-dwelling
    "allies!"
  hellion+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: I claim the good meat! Do not challenge me!
  hellion+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Obviously, I deserve the lion's share...
  hellion+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: I have trained for battles of this sort! Stand
    aside!
  hellion+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Stop your flailing. The ancestors have forsaken
    us.
  hellion+str_block_buff_depressed_1: No! We have but one chance... FIIIGHT!
  hellion+str_block_buff_depressed_2: If you pity me, then end my pain... do not prolong
    it.
  hellion+str_block_buff_irrational_0: You doubt the warhawk?... Then say so to my
    face.
  hellion+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Try that again and I'll cleave you in twain.
  hellion+str_block_buff_irrational_2: That's your last warning. Meddle again and
    die.
  hellion+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: Let them cut me... Let them lay bare my warrior
    soul.
  hellion+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: I may bleed, yes. But my will is forged in
    steel.
  hellion+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: No. I will drown them in my flood.
  hellion+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Black majicks! You would poison my pure soul!
  hellion+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: It seems like power... but it is surely corruption!
  hellion+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: Ha! I may look a primitive, but I am no fool!
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: My appetite seems as weak as my swing...
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: What I would not give for meat from
    the bone...
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: I eat it live, or not at all.
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: The elders spirits have commanded a
    fast. I submit.
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: Like the wolf, I hunt best when famished.
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Starvation is a predator's most encouraging
    ally.
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: "(draws weapon) You try to poison me?
    COWARD!"
  hellion+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: I will gut myself before eating this.
    (draws weapon)
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Coward! Fight on your own or
    not at all!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: You have blood? Then spill
    it as I do!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Foolish city-folk... Do you
    not know guile is a sin?
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: I'd rather lop my hand off
    than dishonor you with it.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: You deserve better than my
    primitive offerings.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Surely your modern ways must
    exceed my own.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: No... the spirits cannot hear
    me in this awful place.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: "(heavy, panicked breathing)"
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: SHH! ... Growling, near to
    us... some fell beast...
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: "(insane snarling)"
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: I'll tear your arm off.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Shh... shhhhhhh... the elder
    spirits are speaking...
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Blood and bruises are trophies.
    Why prevent them?
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: No. Our need is not so
    great. Not yet.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Leave the spirits be. Besides...
    they reward pain.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: Too late! They are coming
    for us! ARM YOURSELF!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Aye, and with my back turned,
    no less?
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: You cannot hide the animal
    hunger in your eyes...
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: The spirits do nothing for
    those who spurn them.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: You must prove yourself first...
    As I have.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: Honor the spirits first. Then
    call on their aid.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Stop that! I do not need your
    meddlesome aid!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: HRRRAA! Touch me again... that
    I may drink your blood!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: The dirt has whispered my name.
    Do not waste your time.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Why? The wild spirits have forsaken
    me. I am done.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: Why, I am pulling out my hair.
    Did you want some?
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: Shhh... there is music in the
    air... so beautiful...
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Bah! Blood alone is the true
    measure of spirit!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: A true warrior bleeds and
    suffers and hurts - it is the way of things!
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: This is not a traditional blessing.
    I decline.
  hellion+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: The elders warned me against
    this sort of... boon.
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: Flight would only compound my failure...
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: I am tempted... but I cannot. The
    ancestors are watching.
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: "(insane growling)"
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: NO! I have marked them with my blood!
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: No! I've tasted death, and I want
    more!
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: I've a victory tale for every scar.
    Why deny another?
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: What?! We're practically winning! Do
    you WANT us to lose?
  hellion+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: You were hoping all along that we'd
    fail... I foresaw this.
  hellion+str_block_heal_depressed_0: To defy death is deny myself...
  hellion+str_block_heal_depressed_1: The elders summon me. I'll not disappoint them
    again.
  hellion+str_block_heal_depressed_2: My soul is dead... None have the right to revive
    it.
  hellion+str_block_heal_irrational_0: "(shriek) I WILL GUT YOU AND EAT YOU!"
  hellion+str_block_heal_irrational_1: STAY BACK!!! THE HUNGER OVERWHELMS ME!!!
  hellion+str_block_heal_irrational_2: hrrrrraaaaaaAAAAAAAAA!!!
  hellion+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Stop... I may lose control of the blood rage...
  hellion+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: NO... Every wound and scar is a blessing!
  hellion+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: Heal me later. For now, the blood serves...
  hellion+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Your touch sullies my warrior soul!
  hellion+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: No. I have ever been suspicious of these... arts.
  hellion+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Your foreign ways are anathema to me!
  hellion+str_block_item_depressed_0: No. If the spirits will my death, so be it.
  hellion+str_block_item_depressed_1: "(pushes you away) The ancestors call to me.
    I must go."
  hellion+str_block_item_irrational_0: "(opens mouth and snaps teeth shut, then grins)"
  hellion+str_block_item_irrational_1: "(licks lips and chuffs like a bull)"
  hellion+str_block_item_masochistic_0: "(smiles) You think me weak? Stand away, and
    watch."
  hellion+str_block_item_masochistic_1: No. My people's mystics have trained me to
    endure pain.
  hellion+str_block_item_paranoid_0: "...You doubt my vigor? I will show you!"
  hellion+str_block_item_paranoid_1: None of your city-folk distractions! Begone!
  hellion+str_block_move_abusive_0: Stop leaping about like a cubling! Hold fast,
    and focus!
  hellion+str_block_move_abusive_1: I am too busy for your "tactics." Fight, or die.
  hellion+str_block_move_fearful_0: "(jabbers nonsensically)"
  hellion+str_block_move_fearful_1: "(ignores you and stares with horror)"
  hellion+str_block_move_irrational_0: "(hisses like a snake)"
  hellion+str_block_move_irrational_1: "(snarls like a wolf)"
  hellion+str_block_move_masochistic_0: I won't get nearly as many wounds there...
  hellion+str_block_move_masochistic_1: I am here for the blood. I'll not move.
  hellion+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Oh no, you'll not escape this time. Hold your
    ground!
  hellion+str_block_move_paranoid_1: I know no advantage to that. What are you hiding?!
  hellion+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Ah. We have pleased a primal spirit. Kee-ragga
    kor, old one.
  hellion+str_buff_party_powerful_1: "(deep sniff) A good day to die."
  hellion+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: "(nodding) The ancestors have granted
    you a powerful boon."
  hellion+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Your soul stinks of blood and conquest.
    (grins)
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I... I fear death... Forgive me, elder
    spirits.
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: I shame the others with my weakness...
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: There is no honor here... only a slow fade
    to nothing.
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: Stay back! This is a dangerous foe!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Cannot... catch... my breath!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Its gaze! So black! So cold!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: A foul wind encompasses them! They exude
    evil!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: Some dark spirit motivates them!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: Not all that walks this earth is OF this
    earth....
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Take my place! I must sharpen my blade!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I must conserve my strength!
  hellion+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Bravery is one thing; recklessness, another.
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: If I cannot have victory, I must have death.
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Redeem me, creature. I have faltered.
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: One last rush then... for the elder spirits.
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: RAAAAAAAAAA!
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: BLOOOOOD! GIVE ME BLOOOOOOOOOD!
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Place your mark upon my body. I wish to
    remember this.
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Honor me with a scar. Please... I beg
    you.
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Come! Illustrate my flesh with a tale
    of war!
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Get behind me! This is warrior's work!
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: I cannot SEE for all your flailing!
  hellion+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: I shall release this one... It is my due!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: "... If it were me, that would have
    been a killing blow."
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: Yes, fine. Now step aside!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: FIGHT! FIIIIIIGHT!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Yes! Taste their blood on your
    lips!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: I don't understand... I thought I
    was the best...
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Stop hogging all the glory!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Stand aside. Let a true warrior
    through.
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Dishonor! You must fight with
    your heart! OR FAIL!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: The elders never warned me of
    such... evils.
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: How can any warrior - man or woman
    - face such horrors...?
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: "(growls and salivates)"
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: OOOOWOOOOOOOOOOOO! OOOOWOOOO-WOOO-WOOOOOOOO!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: The spirits have cursed you.
    Your very presence is death.
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You are possessed by a spirit
    of misfortune!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Stop fooling about! We are moving
    too slowly for my tastes!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: You're not working hard enough!
    Look to me for an example!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: You should never have come with us anyway...
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: War is not your profession, clearly...
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Why, spirits?! Why abandon us now, in the
    hour of our need?
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Please, ancestors... please grant me strength...
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: "(low whimpering)"
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: They come for us... for our sweet, sweet
    flesh...
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: My turn! I long to bleed! To show my
    honor!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Your pain is your gift. Now hurl it
    back at your foe!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: They smell our fear...
  hellion+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: They have hunted us! They know our weaknesses!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: How can you be so weak?! FIGHT!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: They have the bloodfury... They will
    destroy us!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Kaaa-LEE-LEE-LEE-LEE-LEE-LEE-KHARONGAAAA!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: The wise-men say camel dung incense
    is the best... S'true.
  hellion+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: Deceiver... You conspire with them!
    Deny it!
  hellion+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: I knew it! You city-folk cannot be trusted!
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: Such power...Surely it is guided by evil
    spirits!
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: Hear me, ancestors! Deliver me!
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: "(roars like a lion)"
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: "(laughs like a hyena)"
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: "(grinning snarl)"
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Aye! Like two beasts in the dirt!
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: The elders sent them to test us. Surely,
    we are doomed.
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: They are too powerful! Perhaps trained
    by our enemies!
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Yes, more, MORE! The scars speak my honor!
  hellion+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Must I do all the work myself?!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: No... dammit, no! How can I be so weak?!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: Dark spirits have blessed this one!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: "(snarls and chews on own arm)"
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: YAKKA YAKKA YEEE-AAAAAA!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Weakness! Take my blood, or quit
    wasting my time!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: You dishonor me... Strike, or you
    can kill yourself!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: One solid blow like that and I am off
    to see the ancestors!
  hellion+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: It has vengeance in its eyes! How have
    I wronged thee?!
  hellion+str_critbyhero_0: KREEE-YAAAAA!
  hellion+str_critbyhero_1: AH-KLORAAAA!
  hellion+str_critbyhero_2: RrrrraaaaAAAAAA!
  hellion+str_critbyhero_3: HA HAAA!
  hellion+str_critbyhero_4: I will FEAST on your HEART!
  hellion+str_critbyhero_5: HA-HA! Spirits claim you!
  hellion+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: I hear the song of the wild... The spirits watch
    me.
  hellion+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: The warhawk cries on the wind. It watches over
    me.
  hellion+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: No. Like the injured falcon, my eyes are
    hooded...
  hellion+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: No. I will not debase my ancestors further...
  hellion+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: The elder spirits listen not. It is pointless...
  hellion+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: "(panicked breathing)"
  hellion+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: No... They are too strong... too strong!
  hellion+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: Such power... There is no stopping them...
  hellion+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: I cannot... my spirit animal flies too
    high...
  hellion+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Clouds and fields... The curvature of the
    earth....
  hellion+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Herds flee and flocks scatter. The predator
    has come.
  hellion+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: No. Their mates will attack us from the rear.
  hellion+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: They are planning a trick! Must not lose
    focus!
  hellion+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: Keen predators remain wary, even of her pack-mates...
  hellion+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I will fight... but on my own terms.
  hellion+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: First promise me a sacrifice in honor of the
    spirits.
  hellion+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: The wind says to wait. And so I shall.
  hellion+str_mark_self_depressed_0: My blood will salt this earth!
  hellion+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Let us make a glorious end then, if nothing else.
  hellion+str_mark_self_irrational_0: The spirits... They cry of... of PAIN AND HORRORS!
  hellion+str_mark_self_irrational_1: The ancestors call for blood! YOUR BLOOD!
  hellion+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Here! Test my skills!
  hellion+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: If you seek blood, then blood you shall have!
  hellion+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: It speaks of my death. And I am unafraid!
  hellion+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: It has enslaved the spirits of dead
    warriors!
  hellion+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: It grasps at my soul!
  hellion+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Send me to hell then! AAAKYLORAAAHHH!
  hellion+str_random_command_abusive_0: You do not know the ways of battle...
  hellion+str_random_command_abusive_1: Your soul stinks of fear. Feh!
  hellion+str_random_command_abusive_2: The spirits have denounced you!
  hellion+str_random_command_depressed_0: Rage has failed me. I may as well beg for
    mercy.
  hellion+str_random_command_depressed_1: Tactics and plans and strategies... Spit
    on it!
  hellion+str_random_command_depressed_2: It was your "leadership" that got me into
    this mess...
  hellion+str_random_command_irrational_0: Breathe deep... the mass-grave burns beneath...
  hellion+str_random_command_irrational_1: The elders speak through me... They say...
    LAMENT!
  hellion+str_random_command_irrational_2: I see the mountains... the fields, the
    dunes...
  hellion+str_random_command_masochistic_0: The blood already flows. Let it rage like
    a torrent!
  hellion+str_random_command_masochistic_1: You think too much! Only blood begets
    blood!
  hellion+str_random_command_masochistic_2: Tsk. Let me handle this... COME AND GET
    ME, FREAKS!
  hellion+str_random_command_paranoid_0: A dark spirit is trying to control me! I
    deny it!
  hellion+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Fortune favours the wary... Now I see why.
  hellion+str_random_command_paranoid_2: The village elders warned me - deception
    is afoot...
  hellion+str_random_command_selfish_0: The elders alone may guide me.
  hellion+str_random_command_selfish_1: Find a reward that suits my skill... Then
    we talk.
  hellion+str_random_command_selfish_2: My honor pleads otherwise.
  hellion+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: Eat of this dried lamb-hock. It will
    restore your courage.
  hellion+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Look at me... You are going to make
    it -- ALL OF YOU!
  hellion+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: The power of the ancient world gives me
    strength.
  hellion+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: The ancestors have blessed me.
  hellion+str_virtued_courageous_0: Our souls are tested -- our true power revealed.
  hellion+str_virtued_courageous_1: We are here, foes. Come make your end.
  hellion+str_virtued_focused_0: The fury of a thousand generations...
  hellion+str_virtued_focused_1: Nothing escapes the eyes of the warhawk.
  hellion+str_virtued_powerful_0: KREEEE-YAAAAAA!
  hellion+str_virtued_powerful_1: Blood and fear mingle on the breeze. (deep sniff)
  hellion+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Hear me, elder spirits! I have passed the test!
  hellion+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Now, bear witness to my unchained soul!
  hellion+str_virtued_vigorous_0: No axe can fell a mountain.
  hellion+str_virtued_vigorous_1: A primal spirit has overtaken me. I am... MORE.
highwayman:
  highwayman+str_afflicted_abusive_0: I will survive this expedition, no thanks to
    you weaklings!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_abusive_1: Tread on my heels again, I'll run you through.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Greenhorns. Feh!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Gah... You reek of warm outhouse.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_abusive_4: I'd rather adventure alone than with you lot.
    Feh.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_depressed_0: The dice have no more jump.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Go, go on! Lead me to my doom!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_depressed_2: This cursed place will be my tomb.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_depressed_3: The things I've done. They pale by comparison...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_depressed_4: I can't get their faces out of my head...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_fearful_0: Caught!  Trapped!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_fearful_1: What foolishness brought me here?!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_fearful_2: We must go for help! Err... better help than
    us!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Curses! I should have brought the blunderbuss!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_fearful_4: What I would not give for a drop of liquid courage...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_irrational_0: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_irrational_1: Come, juggle these daggers with me! Hee heeee!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_irrational_2: I take offense, blaggard! We shall duel at
    dawn!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_irrational_3: Moths have been at my britches! Bring me
    needle and thread!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_irrational_4: You know I apprenticed in candlemaking? T'is
    true.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: I am no shrinking violet when it comes to
    blood!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Ha! What's one more scar?
  highwayman+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: No less than I deserve...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Take aim upon me, blackguard! I defy you!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: This has all been a trap!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: I knew I shouldn't have signed that contract...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: I hear more behind us! Hurry!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Stay on the move... stay on the move...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Cease your prattle! Or they will find us!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Self above else!
  highwayman+str_afflicted_selfish_1: All for one! And the one is me, naturally.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_selfish_2: So long as there's gold to be had, I'll cut
    on command.
  highwayman+str_afflicted_selfish_3: A talent as splendid as my own hardly comes
    cheap...
  highwayman+str_afflicted_selfish_4: A penny pilfered is a penny earned!
  highwayman+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: You have much to learn if you're to survive
    out here...
  highwayman+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: Your hideous visage shall terrorize these
    lands no longer!
  highwayman+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: You... you have her face! WHY DO YOU
    HAVE HER FACE!?
  highwayman+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: Thieves! You know where my fortune
    is hidden! THIEVES!
  highwayman+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Sorry, friend -- business is business.
  highwayman+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Don't act surprised. I know all about
    your plans.
  highwayman+str_attack_self_depressed_0: Sod it all to hell!
  highwayman+str_attack_self_depressed_1: My sweetheart... I'll be with you presently.
  highwayman+str_attack_self_irrational_0: All this blood that I have spilled... Flow
    free once more.
  highwayman+str_attack_self_irrational_1: "(howling like a wolf)"
  highwayman+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: Huh. That rather does smart.
  highwayman+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: That's nothing. I've done worse in an
    opium den.
  highwayman+str_bark_deathsdoor: Every road ends...
  highwayman+str_bark_encourage_0: Please, use my whetstone. 'Twill hone your edge.
  highwayman+str_bark_encourage_1: I've been told this coin is lucky. You have it.
  highwayman+str_bark_encourage_2: Show me your palm. Hmm... luck and love and long
    life!
  highwayman+str_bark_first_aid_0: Did I wash this needle? Well, too late now.
  highwayman+str_bark_first_aid_1: I cleaned the wound with the last of the wine.
    ... SIGH.
  highwayman+str_bark_first_aid_2: I'm not fond of blood, but at least it's yours.
  highwayman+str_bark_hobby_0: '"... with the night for his throne?" Hmm... tricky.'
  highwayman+str_bark_hobby_1: '"... and he always came home?" ... No, no...'
  highwayman+str_bark_hobby_2: '"... like a dog to a bone?" ... Still not right!'
  highwayman+str_bark_pep_talk_0: Just keep your blade sharp and musket loaded. T'is
    all.
  highwayman+str_bark_pep_talk_1: In, out, and home... though all the richer.
  highwayman+str_bark_pep_talk_2: Let's press on. Things go pear-shaped, we flee.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: Step to the front, my friends! Be the first
    to die!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Faces only a mother could disown.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Little disfiguring might do you a spot a good.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Shut up and go to sleep you blithering
    fools.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Don't you blank-staring ghouls ever sleep?
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Lucky for you, I've sworn never to kill
    children.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: We're going to die here, in the dark.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Eternal sleep sounds fair pleasant
    at the moment.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: I've been saving this one bullet...
    just in case.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: What was that, stay alert you blasted
    fools!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: "(sniff) Undoubtedly a corpse out there
    somewhere..."
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: "... Bah. 'Tis merely coyotes singing
    at the moon. Yes."
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Wheels & potholes - hahaha - we thought
    we were so clever!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: I stuck 'em all... right in their
    bellies....
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: You ever see a man bleed to death?
    It's damn pretty.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: I don't need rest, let's push on
    'til we drop!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: No. If I sleep now, I may get used
    to it.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: I'll keep watch. I scream the loudest
    anyway.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: I know you're all plotting to steal
    my share...
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Touch my pistol and your fingers are
    going in the stew.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: I sleep here. You sleep there. Everybody
    happy.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: What's in it for me?
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Took this ring off the dead. You sleep,
    you weep.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Well, come now, share the pipe around!
    Lordy.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Even the dice and cup have lost their lustre.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: Mother was right. Candlemaking was danger
    enough.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: I've lost blood, true. But I miss the bloodlust
    most.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: I hear the hoofbeats of doom!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: I've had enough - enough!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: Come, let's away! We've lost this!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: Yes, your Regency! I have collected your
    taxes!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Turn out your pockets! Yes, ALL of you!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: May I have the first dance, m'lady?
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: I welcome the hangman's noose!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Aye, let us trade amputations like warriors
    of yore!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Cut me if you like. I'll decapitate you
    in turn.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: I can hear the ghosts of my victims past
    scream for my soul!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: They were ready for us... it is a trap!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: They are stalling us! More are surely on
    the way!
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Clear a path to stage left. I may require
    an exit.
  highwayman+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: Fight I shall, but this cat is counting his
    lives.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Don't waste your time on me - I'm done.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_depressed_1: I appreciate what you're doing... but it's
    futile.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_depressed_2: So cruel, to let a man suffer overlong.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Let me alone... she was a diamond, resplendent
    in the moonlight.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Pink flesh turns yellow, then black, then
    grey...
  highwayman+str_block_buff_irrational_2: And yet wherefore does no one sing of Wiglaf?...
    Why?
  highwayman+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: Back off - I like being the underdog.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: No.  Abject terror is motivation enough.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: And fight with confidence?! That's suicide!
  highwayman+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: I'm fine.  Leave me be.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: Sorry... I am wise to trickery and large words.
  highwayman+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: Ha! What snake oil are you selling now?
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: Not like she used to make... (sigh)
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Seems my revelry makes a lousy dining
    partner.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: No! I DIDN'T KILL HER! 'TWAS AN
    ACCIDENT!
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: It... is filled with maggots! Can
    you not see them??
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: Hunger is a useful motivator. Also,
    there's no wine.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: An empty belly always points my
    nose towards victory.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: "(sniff) ... Err, no. Ha."
  highwayman+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Thank you, no. I never eat poison
    after sunset.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Shut up. You moan like a
    cow.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: "... Do you weep when it
    rains as well?"
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: I'd rather teach these layabouts
    to fish. Follow?
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: Sorry, I've already given
    up.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: What do you hope to gain?
    Certainly not victory.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: You ask the blind to lead
    the blind.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: What?! I see eyes in the
    dark! Familiar eyes!
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: "(grunt) My hands shake
    like a rudder in a storm!"
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: No! We should flee, not
    stand about lolly-gagging!
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: I did what I had to.  That
    jail was hellish...
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: I feel her arms around
    me... How did I ever leave?
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: A herd of cattle... a
    narrow passage...
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: That one? Barely a scratch
    on 'em!
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Aye, and a back-rub,
    too? This is no steamship cruise!
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Nonsense... fungus thrives
    in dung.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: A magician never reveals
    his tricks.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Look out for yourself.
    That's the rule of the road.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: Ha! They'd rather cut me
    open than return the favor.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: Sorry... Keeping that one
    for later.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: Pardon me, but I AM trying
    to make a living here.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: Seems a mite excessive,
    don't it?
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Heh, no. You can't con a con
    artist.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: A fine trick for a carnie.
    Take your pathetic show on the road.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Bugger off. I'm in no mood
    for mothering.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Nay. And if no one minds,
    I'll turn in.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: "... can't think... can't
    see... can't breathe..."
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: Come at me again and I will
    split your gullet.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Your arts would only blunt
    the pain...
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: A kind gesture, but panic
    suits me just fine.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: That's about close enough,
    thank you.
  highwayman+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: I'll not be indebted to you
    or anyone.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: There's nowhere to run. So sit
    your ass down.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: Please, I wish to at least DIE
    like a man.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: No turning back. Take the road
    to its very end.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: I've been down that road. Nothing
    but black misery...
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Sometimes victory costs more
    than one is willing to pay.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: I'm rather enjoying myself. So
    feck off.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: Hold fast. Plenty of time to betray
    us later.
  highwayman+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: Wouldn't survive long on the road
    with that attitude. Heh.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_depressed_0: Don't waste your time on me.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_depressed_1: It's not worth it... Just leave me be.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_depressed_2: I don't need your help. Nor do I desire it.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_irrational_0: You expect some kind of payment? Hands off!
  highwayman+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Just a little vinegar and brown paper, please.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_irrational_2: Tis of no use!  The tide will wash the sandcastle
    away!
  highwayman+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: What's life without a few scars?
  highwayman+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: Nuh-uh... the pain keeps me moving.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: What, and ruin this lovely ragged scar?
    I think not!
  highwayman+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Hands off, I'm fine.
  highwayman+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: Found your chance to strike, have you?
  highwayman+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Sorry, friend... I know your kind of "medicine."
  highwayman+str_block_item_depressed_0: No. You see, it's been a long road. Too long,
    I fear.
  highwayman+str_block_item_depressed_1: Why bother to save me? I am just an old horse.
  highwayman+str_block_item_irrational_0: She has followed me on the road... A white
    silhouette.
  highwayman+str_block_item_irrational_1: I am no fisherman, but I believe these waters
    have piranha!
  highwayman+str_block_item_masochistic_0: Stop fiddling with that. We are too busy.
  highwayman+str_block_item_masochistic_1: What, that? It's a trifle. Carry on.
  highwayman+str_block_item_paranoid_0: Look, I am no paranoiac, but did you wash
    that?
  highwayman+str_block_item_paranoid_1: "... I'll be just fine. Best attend to the
    others."
  highwayman+str_block_move_abusive_0: Isn't there something useful you should be
    doing?
  highwayman+str_block_move_abusive_1: Oh, you want this spot? Pity.
  highwayman+str_block_move_fearful_0: No. Seems I've discovered my hill to die on.
  highwayman+str_block_move_fearful_1: "...and jack fell down and broke his crown..."
  highwayman+str_block_move_irrational_0: Wh-who is she...? A phantasm, luminous in
    the twilight!
  highwayman+str_block_move_irrational_1: I can hear you... but your words flow together
    like whisky!
  highwayman+str_block_move_masochistic_0: Mmm, no. How am I supposed to die quickly
    over there?
  highwayman+str_block_move_masochistic_1: Honestly, I am enjoying the odd bang-up.
    I will hold.
  highwayman+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Your strategy eludes me... perhaps intentionally.
  highwayman+str_block_move_paranoid_1: Yes, this IS the best place to pilfer the
    loot. Heh.
  highwayman+str_buff_party_powerful_0: I'll give ten percent to all of you, if we
    survive.
  highwayman+str_buff_party_powerful_1: My finest snuff bag to the one who kills the
    most.
  highwayman+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Now get us back alive and I'll
    toss in some coin.
  highwayman+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Look at you, all ready to knock
    some skulls!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: What's the point?
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: I'll not die here -- or maybe, I will.  What
    does it matter?
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Feh - your turn to get beat up.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: I'm not ready for this!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Discretion, valor, et cetera!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: I am indeed many shades of fool, but I'm
    not stupid!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: This is too easy... Some trick is afoot!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: Watch your back! Others are certainly
    close!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: They've been tracking us! We must mask
    our scent!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Time to make myself scarce...
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I need room to reload!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Why am I so close?! I have A GUN!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: Let's get this over with.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Step aside. Let a true blackguard have
    his due.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: If the guillotine is inevitable, let
    it fall here, now.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Down the rabbit hole, Alice! Hehehe!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: Hehehe, I must still be in solitary
    confinement...
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Ticket? Lord, no, I'm a stowaway.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: I'm all in, anyway...
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Come then. I'm already dead on the
    inside.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Time for some redemption.
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: I'll loot their pockets, their fillings!
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Death only signals the battle for loot.
    Hence...
  highwayman+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: The enemy weakens! Here -- I shall finish
    them off!
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Good. Not great. But good.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: Your dumb luck is holding, it
    seems.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Fine work, brother. Now we
    drink.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: "(insane giggling)"
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Great, now step aside and let
    a professional in.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Sigh. Is it my turn yet?
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: "... Have you considered a
    career in the carpentry arts?"
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Not the BEST display I've seen.
    Possibly the worst.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: Well... I think we've gone
    and snuffed it now.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: About that plan B I've heard
    so much about...
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: "(muttering) Truly, I love
    thee, girl. I love thee, s'true."
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: "(sobbing) No.... no,no,no...."
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: "... How much are they paying
    you?"
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You do not trick me... You
    want us ALL dead!
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: We'll be here all night at
    this rate...
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: Can we move things along? We're
    well past my bedtime.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: Aren't you dead yet?
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: You make a fine target. And little else.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Perhaps we should go? Yes, I vote for
    retreat.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Let us be off! We can catch them up later!
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: WHO ARE THESE GHOSTS? FROM WHENCE
    HAVE YOU COME??
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: Thank you, but no. I have already
    eaten this morning.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Dear me, I rather like you all sweaty
    and fraught.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Splash of gore suits you, I dare
    say.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: Well, that's it. They've sussed us.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Even if we win this, more will come.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: Gods' blood! Can't you see it's useless!?
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: I've no loyalty to courage! Let us
    flee! NOW!
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: "(sobs uncontrollably)"
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: "(drinks)...Huh? You don't expect
    me to fight sober, do you?"
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: Huh. How deftly you dodged that blow...
    How deftly indeed.
  highwayman+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: You're working with them... Wish
    I'd thought of that.
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: UNGH! ... Drek...that does it for me.
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: HUNH! Heh... good.. very good. Can we
    go now?
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: I... I... (sobs)
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Be strong! My brothers will be here
    by nightfall!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Couple more of those and all pain
    will be a memory.
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Huh. Not bad. Not bad at all!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: AAGH! Somebody fouled up! The tip was
    a trap!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: Expedition my arse! More like extermination!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Grr! All this blood must be repaid!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: What?! How did I get fooled into this
    band of greenhorns?
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: I'm alright... (gasping)... It was
    just a graze!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: "(yell of fright)"
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: Shhh... I see more of 'em hiding
    on the brothel balcony.
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Her form, writhing under sheets.
    A dark spot spreads...
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Come on! Just a wound or two to
    impress the lady-folk!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: "(growl) Try a little higher next
    time!"
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: This is no coincidence! They have
    been hunting me!
  highwayman+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: I recognize this one! From a dark
    alley in town!
  highwayman+str_critbyhero_0: Didn't see that coming, did you?
  highwayman+str_critbyhero_1: I never miss.
  highwayman+str_critbyhero_2: Right where it hurts!
  highwayman+str_critbyhero_3: You're outmatched.
  highwayman+str_critbyhero_4: Ha haa!
  highwayman+str_critbyhero_5: Damn -- I missed your eyes!
  highwayman+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Hmmm... I am feeling almost confident today.
  highwayman+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: Disaster always strikes when things are going
    so well...
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: Bah - it's just not in the cards.
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: Can't you see?! WE'VE LOST!
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: I must flee, I must escape!
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: No!... I'm still reloading!
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: Yes, yes, I'll do it. Eventually...
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: She rode in an ivory stagecoach - a
    vision in the night...
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Did you know the female spider eats
    her mate? Tis true.
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: '"The hero dies in vain / a sound trade
    for a touch of fame."'
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: You're all just waiting for me to turn
    my back!
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I don't make rash decisions.
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: No.  I'll not let my "friends" see me
    the fool.
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I'm looking out for myself.
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: Ha! If I fancied blind idiocy, I'd join
    the army.
  highwayman+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: It's only a fair share if I live to share
    it.
  highwayman+str_mark_self_depressed_0: Well... it was a good run. ... HEY! UGLY!
    YEAH, YOU!
  highwayman+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Stand and deliver, fool! Send me to my love!
  highwayman+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Did you know I'm immortal? Come, see for
    yourself.
  highwayman+str_mark_self_irrational_1: Come, you filthy dog. Gain some self-respect.
  highwayman+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: You there! Something unsavory about your
    parentage!
  highwayman+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: An unruly lot, but a capable one? Doubtful!
  highwayman+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: I... I see my death! Stabbed in the
    back by an ally!
  highwayman+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: Gods! The earth crawls with these
    bastards!
  highwayman+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: Reanimated bones...how can such a thing
    exist!?
  highwayman+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: No way out. hmph. Let's
    do this.
  highwayman+str_random_command_abusive_0: There is no justice on the road, only survival!
  highwayman+str_random_command_abusive_1: Just hand me the noose and save yourself
    the trouble!
  highwayman+str_random_command_abusive_2: I may be reckless, but you are all idiots!
  highwayman+str_random_command_depressed_0: It's better this way - what do I care.
  highwayman+str_random_command_depressed_1: Flail and fight... What do I care?
  highwayman+str_random_command_depressed_2: Looks like the road's finally come to
    an end.
  highwayman+str_random_command_irrational_0: I could've run away with her. But like
    a fool, I chose the pit!
  highwayman+str_random_command_irrational_1: To oblivion with you! / Dagger, flintlock
    and brew!
  highwayman+str_random_command_irrational_2: Stop, stop! May we instead part ways
    peacefully?
  highwayman+str_random_command_masochistic_0: I'll take those odds!
  highwayman+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Daft maybe, but bravery counts for
    something.
  highwayman+str_random_command_masochistic_2: Pick on me - I can take it!
  highwayman+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I'm wise to your schemes!
  highwayman+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Stab me in the back?! That's my trick!
  highwayman+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Oh, aye, and bend over while I'm at it?
  highwayman+str_random_command_selfish_0: I'm only out for myself.
  highwayman+str_random_command_selfish_1: May I suggest a more subtle approach?
  highwayman+str_random_command_selfish_2: "... To be honest, guile is more my thing."
  highwayman+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: Drink this. Inebriation is your best
    ally, I always say.
  highwayman+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: We push on - past those fallen in
    their tracks!
  highwayman+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: Bah. Who needs brandy when you've got
    false courage.
  highwayman+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: I feel good. Something bad will surely
    happen momentarily.
  highwayman+str_virtued_courageous_0: We'll ride to hell if need be!
  highwayman+str_virtued_courageous_1: Fear not the hangman, nor the reaper!
  highwayman+str_virtued_focused_0: No shot shall miss the mark while I aim it!
  highwayman+str_virtued_focused_1: I am alert - like a prowling cat!
  highwayman+str_virtued_powerful_0: Taste the sting of blade and ball, fool!
  highwayman+str_virtued_powerful_1: The shadows grow too long for fooling around.
  highwayman+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Life deals harsh lessons. It affects me not!
  highwayman+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Aye, the low road is fraught. But it pays better.
  highwayman+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Never felt better!
  highwayman+str_virtued_vigorous_1: I can handle this, I've been to prison.
houdmaster:
  houdmaster+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Even my brave hound cowers!
  houdmaster+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: These fiends are beyond any of the evils I
    have thwarted!
  houdmaster+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: This is something from my darkest nightmares!
houndmaster:
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_abusive_0: Rats!  Snitches!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_abusive_1: You all make for a sordid lineup, indeed!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Time for a shakedown, you louts!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Have none of you dogs been trained?
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_abusive_4: Lawless brutes - all of you!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_depressed_0: Her tails hang low, the trail is lost.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Law and order - they are delusions.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_depressed_2: Bah, the trail's gone cold.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_depressed_3: What can one man do in the face of such rampant
    corruption?!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_depressed_4: The Law is a cheap perfume - masking the
    stench of malfeasance
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_fearful_0: Terror overwhelms duty!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_fearful_1: The pursuit of Justice leads only to agony
    and death!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_fearful_2: This simple beast fears death as I do.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Let it be swift and painless!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Each step leads deeper into this waking nightmare!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_irrational_0: This is no mere dog, this is the first being
    to orbit our terrestrial sphere!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_irrational_1: Gah! This snake has usurped the leash!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Havoc!  Havoc!  uh...I forget the rest...
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_irrational_3: It seems my stitches conspire to knot together
    and hang me!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Help! I am leashed to dozens of these hellhounds!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Blood makes the hunt more thrilling!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: I can take a beating - come on!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Pain sharpens our senses, doesn't it, girl?
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Crime made poignant through flayed flesh
    and mortified bruises!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: The law is held fast by the blood of lawmen!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Corruption seethes around us!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Stick close, girl! Lawless miscreants lurk
    at every turn...
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: It's a sting!  We're surrounded!
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: They're out to get me - can feel it in my
    gut.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: What is it, girl?  Have they turned on us?
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_selfish_0: The hound comes first. Then me. Then you...
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Pay me my retainer - I've long since quit the
    force.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Our loyalty deserves a larger share.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_selfish_3: I have double the expenses, I want double the
    pay.
  houndmaster+str_afflicted_selfish_4: The two of us are worth more than twelve of
    you!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: I told you not touch her!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: That's what you get for fouling the trail!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_abusive_2: Smarten up!  Your incompetence will get
    us all killed!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: A nip on your heels!  Ha ha!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: Where was the Opium going?  Answer
    me!  Where?!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Let's see you try something now!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: The hound can sense your deceit!
  houndmaster+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_2: You!  Conspirator!
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_depressed_0: Even the pain is dulled by this lacklustre
    existence.
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Ah! The old familiar sting.
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_irrational_0: "... had me cornered - said if I didn't
    talk they beat it out of me!"
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_irrational_1: "...and then Paulson struck me - just
    like this!"
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_irrational_2: "...so I beat him to a pulp - like this!"
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: I need more...!
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Agony sharpens our wits and our senses!
  houndmaster+str_attack_self_masochistic_2: I'll show you how to do it!
  houndmaster+str_bark_encourage_0: Keep your minds clear and watch each other's back.  We're
    partners, after all.
  houndmaster+str_bark_encourage_1: Give her a pet - always brightens the spirit.
  houndmaster+str_bark_encourage_2: We are the hunters, and the law is on our side.
  houndmaster+str_bark_first_aid_0: The hound's tongue will clean your wounds.
  houndmaster+str_bark_first_aid_1: Have a nip of this, always worked for me if some
    lout cut me on patrol.
  houndmaster+str_bark_first_aid_2: Standard constabulatory issue for that sort of
    ailment.
  houndmaster+str_bark_hobby_0: "...and that's when I learned the hound could sing!"
  houndmaster+str_bark_hobby_1: Cooking meat robs it of its nutrifying essence.
  houndmaster+str_bark_hobby_2: It is certain that anyone in politics has been corrupted
    in some fashion or another.
  houndmaster+str_bark_pep_talk_0: The hound has the trail. We are certain to succeed.
  houndmaster+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Every brigand, every miscreant is terrified of
    those who serve law and order.
  houndmaster+str_bark_pep_talk_2: We work together, stay focused.  We'll get out
    of this mess.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: If I require counsel I will confer with my
    dog.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Lawbreakers - all of you!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Brace up, you damnable fools!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Swine!  You will make room for my dog
    at the fire!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Go on - ask the her to return your 'share'
    of the stew...heh
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Yes, she bites.  Buffoon.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: I wonder if lawlessness is simply
    the natural way of things.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Not hungry.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: There was a time when such a ribald
    tune would have us clapping and howling...
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: We're exposed, surrounded.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: We don't like the scent of this place.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: She growls.  Stay alert, there's something
    nearby.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: How strange none of you have laughed
    at my hound's brilliant jest?
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: No Captain, I won't shake him down
    - I won't!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: "...but poor Saunders saw fit to
    prosecute anyway, and well, you can imagine how that played out."
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Hand me that poker. I need a lashing.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: We bask in the raw glow of a stitched
    wound.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Dull sleep or the raw thrill of
    senses pushed beyond their limits?
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: Any of you try anything and the hound
    will tear you to pieces.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: One of you is on the take - we can
    smell it!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Someone - or some thing in the darkness
    means to do us harm.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_3: At least one of you has the aspect
    of villainy.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Of course we're out of meat.  Have you
    seen the size of my dog?
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Put out that pipe! You'll foul the hound's
    nose for the trail!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: I have no control over where the dog
    does its business!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Where does one start to fight that which
    rots everyone and everything?
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: I've led you astray, girl.  Wasted our
    lives.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: Feh - going to turn in my badge.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: By all that is holy, this buzzing is merciless!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Be careful, everything is covered in blood!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Of course the hound talks, it's the one
    that told you it could!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Blood fuels all Justice!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Give it to me.  I can take it.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Pain! Better us than the innocent!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: One of our own has misled us!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Someone...or some THING has corrupted our
    cohorts!
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: What is it, girl? You smell something foul
    in our midst...
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: This hound deserves more praise than any
    of you.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: We uncovered the trail, you merely followed
    along.
  houndmaster+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: We've spent our lives keeping the order -
    we want what's ours!
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_depressed_0: "(whimpers)"
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_depressed_1: There is nothing left inside to remedy.
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_depressed_2: We would go quietly.
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_irrational_0: I'm simply too buried in paperwork right
    now...
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_irrational_1: "...no, no.  I won't be party to...whatever
    it is your accused of doing."
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_irrational_2: It is for the hound to decide.  What do
    you say, girl?
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: Agony sharpens our senses!
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: You can't understand the ecstacy we experience.
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Now is the time for bleeding, stiches
    can come later.
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: There are always strings attached.
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: I don't take bribes.  Never have.
  houndmaster+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: We know where you stand in this, craven.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I won't eat if the hound has no
    will to eat.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: We have no will for it.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: The hound and I cannot seem to
    agree on what to eat!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: They eat better than this in prison!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_2: "...and deny the roaches their
    supper?  I think not."
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: It is violence and blood that
    feeds us.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: We fight better bloodied and famished.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: Who packed the food?  I don't trust
    it.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Fah! We once hung a man who killed
    by crushing glass into meals.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Hahahah! No.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: I'll save that for those
    I consider my equals.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: We are of no benefit
    to the party.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: Ask one of our cohorts
    with something to offer this retinue.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: We need to save our strength
    in this horrible place!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: N-no, I must stay close
    to her.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: Every act brings us closer
    to our terrible fates!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: Ruff! Ruff! Grrrrrrr!!!!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: Wait, try putting the
    collar on me - just to see how it looks!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: You rub it in our faces,
    you with your delightful cuts and bruises.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Suffering drives away
    corruption!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Is it too much pleasure
    to suffer so?
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: Are you mad? They could
    be attacking any second now!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Feign injury to bait the
    trap eh?
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: Never try anything with
    the hound watching.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: We are busy de-lousing.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: Too busy trying to sleep!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: We're fine here by the
    fire.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Maybe if you seemed more competent?
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: We're fine without your pity!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: It still wouldn't help us
    any.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: We are long past any aid.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: I walked a beat for so
    many years, feels good just to lay here in the grass...
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: "...well sure enough, by
    the time we arrived, the evidence had been destroyed..."
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Every wound is an ensorceling
    kiss from Lady Justice herself!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: Our suffering is ecstatic!
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: That might play tricks with
    our instincts.  Which we assume was your ploy.
  houndmaster+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: Aha - the criminal element
    exposes itself...
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: Trail leads here.  Here's where
    we stay.
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: Time to face the music.
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: "...wait - I'm at the best part
    of the story!"
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: "...they had hidden the grog
    beneath the floorboards!  Well, I couldn't help but admire their ingenuity..."
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Victory or defeat, if it ends
    in pain then we are richer for it!
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: But these wounds are so...disappointing.
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: No!  We stay to fight for the law
    - for order!
  houndmaster+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: Gnash your teeth!  Growl your defiance!
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_depressed_0: And what would this pathetic wretch do with
    that?
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_depressed_1: Just go away.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_depressed_2: There is no cure for corruption of the spirit.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_irrational_0: We prefer the pretty nurse who smells like
    roses and roasted chicken.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Not a chance - I remember you from the
    lineup!
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_irrational_2: I've seen your face on a wanted poster,
    I'm sure of it.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Are you blind to my enjoyment of this
    sting?
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: We prefer our wounds unlicked.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: Only salt for my wounds, thanks.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: We don't like the smell of it.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: She growls - best you back away.
  houndmaster+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: "(growls)"
  houndmaster+str_block_item_depressed_0: Every dog knows when its time draws near.
  houndmaster+str_block_item_depressed_1: Surely a waste.
  houndmaster+str_block_item_irrational_0: We're busy sharing this bone!
  houndmaster+str_block_item_irrational_1: That is not the card I picked - cheat!
  houndmaster+str_block_item_masochistic_0: You ignore the virtue of suffering.
  houndmaster+str_block_item_masochistic_1: There is no better balm than searing wounds!
  houndmaster+str_block_item_paranoid_0: The hound smells venom!
  houndmaster+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Too freely offered!
  houndmaster+str_block_move_abusive_0: And I suggest you take it up with my dog!
  houndmaster+str_block_move_abusive_1: Do not try that again or I will see that she
    feeds on your hand.
  houndmaster+str_block_move_fearful_0: Prickling fur, low growl...No, we stay.
  houndmaster+str_block_move_fearful_1: What is it, girl?  Danger..?
  houndmaster+str_block_move_irrational_0: Quiet, I'm close to cracking the case!
  houndmaster+str_block_move_irrational_1: I'm staying put - I won't be forced from
    duty!
  houndmaster+str_block_move_masochistic_0: This feels like the spot of greatest danger
    and excitement!
  houndmaster+str_block_move_masochistic_1: We dare not move lest we miss out...
  houndmaster+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Back, girl.  Let us sit and watch for signs
    of conspiracy.
  houndmaster+str_block_move_paranoid_1: A fixed position forces corruption to expose
    itself.
  houndmaster+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Get 'em girl!
  houndmaster+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Now is the time - take them down!
  houndmaster+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Follow your instincts! They
    lead true!
  houndmaster+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Gather your wits!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: This hopeless pursuit puts my girl
    at risk - I won't have it!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: Back, girl, it's hopeless, but maybe
    you can save yourself...
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Slink back, suffer not another blow.
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: Ayee!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Too close!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Back, girl - watch out!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_irrational_0: AAARRROOOOO!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_irrational_1: A cascade of knives! Everyone get
    back!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_irrational_2: I smell delicious bones 'neath this
    spot!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: Betrayers!  Turncoats!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: hm.  I don't like it.
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: We're not falling for that!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: The hound's health comes before any of
    you.
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Not all glory requires sacrifice. At
    least, not my sacrifice.
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: What? Risk our lives in pointless melee?
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: This is a death march, thus onwards
    to finish it.
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Come quickly, Death. You've found us
    at last.
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Each step heavier than the last...
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: The evidence is irrefutable!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: Suit yourself but I won't tolerate
    another chamber pot dumped on our heads!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Aha!  The final clue!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Duty made sweeter with delicious sacrifice!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Give me another one!  Right in the
    jaw!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Wounds heat up the chase!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Step aside! We alone can bring these fiends
    to justice!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: I deserve the reward for apprehending
    these miscreants!
  houndmaster+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: Thank you for your work, we'll take it
    from here.
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: I am the judge, the jury, and
    the gallows!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: My faithful hound - my sweet
    princess!  Tear at their flesh, that you may be adorned in bloody finery!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: We don't like you either!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Quickly! Describe the incident,
    that I may apprehend the culprit!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: The reward will still be mine
    to claim!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Respect our right to the quarry!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: The hound should get your
    share!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Untrained buffoons, all of
    you!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: The beginning of the end..!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Terror shakes us all.
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: "...Paulson couldn't hit
    the broadside of a barn, either!  Died his first week on the force."
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: Are we fighting AGAIN?!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Duplicity!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: What disgusting miming!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: We could have landed that!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: Feel free to sit this one
    out.
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: You belong in cells.
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: Oaf!  You foul the trail!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: That would have certainly sealed my
    demise.
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: How much more blood does this place
    demand?!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: "...so I said I'd let him off with
    a warning..."
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: "...but of course, Captain, I will
    wash your horse!"
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Unfair, we have been yearning...
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Save one of those for me!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: We are mired in wicked plots.
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: That blow was proof of corruption in
    our ranks!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: Your lack of focus dooms us all!
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: "...they met me in the warehouse,
    at the scene of the crime."
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: "...well, of course I couldn't
    go to the Duke, he was in on it!"
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: Are you throwing the fight?
  houndmaster+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: Why would you do that?!  Why indeed...
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: This is what they want isn't it?!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: Now will they leave us alone?!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: Hah!  I am housebroken!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: "...ow!"
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Barely satisfying, harder next time!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Ah that was worth the wait!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: Show yourselves, transgressors!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: This what you wanted, isn't it my cohorts?!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: And why did no one move to stop that?
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: This would have felled a lesser being!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Why have we not fled?!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: That should have been the end of
    us!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: That was a bit close for melee
    practice!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Keep fanning, the heat in this
    cell is dreadful!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Oh you want me to beg for it!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Not even a taste of sublime violent
    bliss?
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: And my cohorts conveniently slink
    away!
  houndmaster+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: Who is in league with whom?!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_0: Praise the steadfast hound!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_1: For Justice!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_2: The quarry falters!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_3: Mercy is for the courts!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_4: No quarter given!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_5: Hah!
  houndmaster+str_critbyhero_6: Let us finish the hunt!
  houndmaster+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: There is no time to bleed!
  houndmaster+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: I cannot - I WILL not - falter in the pursuit
    of evil!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: Mired in corruption!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: Never commit yourself to Justice, it
    demands too much.
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: Good a place as any - let us fall here.
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: If the dog doesn't want to, I don't want
    to.
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: We're doomed either way!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: The trail reeks of doom, why follow it?
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Lady Justice?!  B-but I thought you
    were blind?
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Hush! I can smell their thoughts!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Unbelievable - they let him walk?  Who
    paid off the judge?!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: We smell corruption and we won't fall
    prey to its schemes.
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I won't be betrayed again!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: No more lies!  No more ruses!
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: We don't take orders from anyone.  Not
    anymore.
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: I have my own methods, back off.
  houndmaster+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: Easy, girl, best to sit this one out.
  houndmaster+str_mark_self_depressed_0: I will be the bait, it's all I have left
    to give.
  houndmaster+str_mark_self_depressed_1: On me, villains.  Claim your due.
  houndmaster+str_mark_self_irrational_0: I'll bring the whole brigade down upon you!
  houndmaster+str_mark_self_irrational_1: The thread has frayed here, take a look!
  houndmaster+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Time to prove ourselves!
  houndmaster+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Deliver the pain - if you can!
  houndmaster+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: This world is for the cold and hard,
    not the idealist!
  houndmaster+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: No comrade would see to our backs!
  houndmaster+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: We are alone in our empty pursuit of
    justice!
  houndmaster+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Steady, girl. If we're
    called, we answer.
  houndmaster+str_random_command_abusive_0: I would'nt expect any of you to understand
    our veteran methods!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_abusive_1: The hound has a better instinct than any
    of you lot!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_abusive_2: Hamper not our investigation!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_depressed_0: I feel nothing -do my instincts still
    serve me?
  houndmaster+str_random_command_depressed_1: We have fallen for a red herring and
    now we flounder.
  houndmaster+str_random_command_depressed_2: Nothing makes sense, the scent is lost.
  houndmaster+str_random_command_irrational_0: Rule number one! Always follow a primrose
    scent!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_irrational_1: Tonight, she will have the steak, while
    I eat from the floor!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_irrational_2: We may have our disagreements, but
    the hound and I both agree that blue is best.
  houndmaster+str_random_command_masochistic_0: I've been beaten up before, this is
    nothing!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_masochistic_1: More - give me your best shot!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_masochistic_2: What's one more wound to lick?
  houndmaster+str_random_command_paranoid_0: Our methods must remain secret if we
    are to catch the conspirators!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Corruption is ripe here in these ranks!
    We will find you!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Flush them out, girl!  Get 'em!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_selfish_0: I do what's best for me and my girl.
  houndmaster+str_random_command_selfish_1: We follow our instincts!
  houndmaster+str_random_command_selfish_2: Our senses are attuned to the ways of
    disorder!
  houndmaster+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: No lawlessness, corruption or scandal
    will thwart our righteous purpose!
  houndmaster+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Be inspired by the purity of the
    hunt!
  houndmaster+str_stress_heal_stalwart_0: My conscience is clear! I fight for what
    is right!
  houndmaster+str_stress_heal_stalwart_1: The hunt must continue!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_courageous_0: I've stood up to worse - we can do this!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_courageous_1: I am the Law!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_focused_0: Look closely, you can see their weaknesses!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_focused_1: My gut tells me they are faltering!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_powerful_0: Bring down the hammer of justice!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_powerful_1: Her ears perk up - strike hard and without mercy!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Miscreants! Fly from our unerring pursuit!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Nose to the ground - we always get our man!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Our ideals bring us strength!
  houndmaster+str_virtued_vigorous_1: We'll never stop, never compromise.
jester:
  jester+str_afflicted_abusive_0: HA HAA HAAAAAA! (spits)
  jester+str_afflicted_abusive_1: "(snort, spit) There, that's my opinion."
  jester+str_afflicted_abusive_2: You can all die. Simple as that.
  jester+str_afflicted_abusive_3: I am in like company. Unfortunately for them.
  jester+str_afflicted_abusive_4: Be polite? Would rather die of plague.
  jester+str_afflicted_depressed_0: What a sad display, us lumbering apes.
  jester+str_afflicted_depressed_1: All this leather and steel and blood... for what?
  jester+str_afflicted_depressed_2: We stink of will and confidence. What a crock.
  jester+str_afflicted_depressed_3: We think we have purpose here? A noble venture?
    HA!
  jester+str_afflicted_depressed_4: Just another sick demonstration of hubris. (snort)
  jester+str_afflicted_fearful_0: Err... Eh heh. Ha. Err....
  jester+str_afflicted_fearful_1: Ha haaa! Haaaa! Aaaaaaaaah!
  jester+str_afflicted_fearful_2: Well, so much for bravery.
  jester+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Some idiot once told me all bravery comes from fear.
  jester+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Which prancing fop led me down here anyway??
  jester+str_afflicted_irrational_0: HA HAA HAAAAAA!
  jester+str_afflicted_irrational_1: Hee hee. Hee. Heee heeee heeeeeeee. Hee. Heh.
  jester+str_afflicted_irrational_2: MWU-HA HA HAAAAAA!
  jester+str_afflicted_irrational_3: HA HAAAA! (sobbing) HA HAAHAAAA! (sobbing) Hee-hee!
  jester+str_afflicted_irrational_4: "(crying and laughing)"
  jester+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Heh heh heh heh. Heh. Heh-heh. Heh. Heh.
  jester+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: AAAAA-HAAAAA!
  jester+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Torture? (shrugs) I'm always game for a little
    fun.
  jester+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Oh, you like knives? Me too... Heh.
  jester+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Yes, drain my blood. I tire of this... "life."
  jester+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Maybe just cut all their throats... To be sure.
  jester+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: So you've finally tricked the trickster.
  jester+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: They take me for a fool. ... Fair, I suppose.
  jester+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: What a fool I've been. Ha. Ha ha. ... Hmm.
  jester+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Let them stand behind me?! AH HA HA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_afflicted_selfish_0: I am not the only performer here. Just the most
    qualified.
  jester+str_afflicted_selfish_1: For twenty-five percent, I give twenty-five percent.
  jester+str_afflicted_selfish_2: No, I did not touch the coin purse. ... Hee-hee.
  jester+str_afflicted_selfish_3: One quarter? Surely you jest.
  jester+str_afflicted_selfish_4: If I must be paid in coinage, make it A LOT of coinage.
  jester+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: There is no peace while your tongue still
    flaps!
  jester+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: The massacre begins with you, you ignorant
    child!
  jester+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: HAAA HA-HA-HA HAAAAA HA-HA-HA HAAAAAA!
  jester+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: "(giddy laughter)"
  jester+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Ha ha, do not lie -- you were about to do
    the same, no?
  jester+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: Looks like I'm the quicker of us two! Ha
    ha haaaa!
  jester+str_attack_self_depressed_0: If you want something done right.
  jester+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Pathetic. I'll not stand another moment of it.
  jester+str_attack_self_irrational_0: HAR HAR HAAAAARRRRRR!
  jester+str_attack_self_irrational_1: "(quiet tittering)"
  jester+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: You see? THAT'S how you kill a clown!
  jester+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Bah, must I do everything myself!?
  jester+str_bark_deathsdoor: At last, the greatest joke of all...
  jester+str_bark_encourage_0: "(sigh) Your whining bothers me. Just... smile!"
  jester+str_bark_encourage_1: "(sigh) Shall I do a little dance to amuse you? Yes?"
  jester+str_bark_encourage_2: If all else fails... laugh. It blinds the mind.
  jester+str_bark_first_aid_0: Nasty ugly thing, this wound. It suits you.
  jester+str_bark_first_aid_1: There. Now you will die much more slowly.
  jester+str_bark_first_aid_2: Good. That should delay your death.
  jester+str_bark_hobby_0: It's called juggling. You never been to a circus?
  jester+str_bark_hobby_1: What do I do for fun? You're joking, right?
  jester+str_bark_hobby_2: I'm practicing my sneering. Pretty good, huh?
  jester+str_bark_pep_talk_0: If we're all going to die, let's at least enjoy it.
  jester+str_bark_pep_talk_1: What's the deal with pinapple?  Am I right?
  jester+str_bark_pep_talk_2: 'Here''s what I think of our enemies: HA HAA HAAAA!'
  jester+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: You're not even worthy of death. Such weakness!
  jester+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: "(snort, spit) Heh. Heh-heh."
  jester+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Just another artifact of man's hubris. Bah!
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Gods. The stink of humanity does truly cling.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: I really do hope you're all dead by morning.
    Goodnight.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: You stupid fools! Laws are merely tools of
    tyranny!
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: No matter where I go, cretins abound.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: I could never kill them all... Another
    vain fantasy.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: My life alone is an insult to my senses...
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: "(nervous laughter)"
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Yes. Let us sit until we are murdered. Brilliant.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: Do we even have a plan? Or are we waiting
    to die?
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Heh. He-heh. Heh-heh-heh. Heh. Heh. Heh-heh.
    Heh.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: "(screaming peals of laughter)"
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: "(sudden roaring laughter)"
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: A few drops of blood in the fire should
    attract them...
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: I'd prefer death over sleeping downwind
    of these apes.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Noise will attract animals, you say?
    AH HA HA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: Maybe kill them all in their sleep. Just
    to be sure...
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Keep these blades close tonight... In case.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Why do they always wait until I've eaten
    first...?
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Cease your shrill laughter. I am getting
    a headache.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: I will finish the food. You're all too fat
    as it is.
  jester+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Try to sleep, you say? Out here?! AH HA HA
    HAAAAA!
  jester+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Heh. (sigh) Heh.
  jester+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: What a joke.
  jester+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: Would that I could quit this world willingly...
  jester+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Why do we hang about here? We are defeated!
  jester+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: Does this earth produce NOTHING that is good?
  jester+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: We're in out of our steps! We must flee!
  jester+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: Heh.
  jester+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: RAH HA HA HA HAAAAAA!
  jester+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: "(giggles uncontrollably)"
  jester+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Yes, destroy me. What a relief that would
    be.
  jester+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: If possible, remove my ears. I tire of their
    wit.
  jester+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: I am no more than a man. And so I deserve
    death.
  jester+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: Should never have gone with you grinning fiends...
  jester+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: I trusted my life to you sneaks.  Truly I am
    the fool.
  jester+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: Sometimes your worst enemies are your "friends"...
  jester+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: No, I won't risk my life for you hopeless clots.
  jester+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Save a decapitation for me, will you?
  jester+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: I've earned my pay. No need overextending myself.
  jester+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Like the rest of this world, I deserve nothing.
  jester+str_block_buff_depressed_1: Your lot is suffering indeed if I am worthy of
    aid.
  jester+str_block_buff_depressed_2: Pfft. I would rather be done with the lot of
    you.
  jester+str_block_buff_irrational_0: HAAAAA! Not for me!
  jester+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Heh. Heh-heh. Heh.
  jester+str_block_buff_irrational_2: HAAA HAAA HAAAAAAAAA!
  jester+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: What's a few injuries? I have endured this
    long, yes?
  jester+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: I would prefer an unadulterated death, thanks.
  jester+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: You silly buffoon. Bleeding is half the fun!
  jester+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Tricks are really my area.
  jester+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: This stinks of witchcraft. What hogwash.
  jester+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: I'll go without the charms, thank you.
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: This foolish eating... I extend my own
    agony.
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: I can stand the pain of starvation...
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA!
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: EEEEE heh-heh-heh HEEEEEEE heh-heh-heh
    HEEEEEEEEEEE!
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: If it makes them look all the worse,
    I will go hungry.
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Starvation has a certain allure for
    me.
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: If you wish to kill me, at least do something
    exciting.
  jester+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: Strong stuff. Boil your knickers in it,
    did you?
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Oh yes, now you would have me
    play nursemaid. I think not.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Put away your toys, little one.
    It is past your bedtime.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: You pathetic failure. I bite
    my tongue at you!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: A fool's errand, that.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: Truly, our hubris knows no
    bounds... and we shall suffer for it.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: What a sham, this expedition...
    What tomfoolery.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: Are you mad?! There's no time
    for that!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: We're all going to die...
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: We are come to the end - a finale
    of sorts.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: Hoo-hoooo-hooooooooo!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: Ah-HAAAAAAAA!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: EEEEE-hee-hee-hee-heeeeee!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: No. We shall lose fair and
    square. It is the fool's way.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: I'd rather gut myself. No,
    I speak true.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: You object to failure? You
    are in the wrong business.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: Conspiracy at Court - intrigue
    is afoot!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: I can't trust any of you!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: "...What have you led us into?
    A trap, is what!"
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: What a ridiculous waste that
    would be.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: Oh, if only I had a copper for
    every fool in the world.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: No. I'll not fritter away my
    skills for you.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: You think that will help? Then
    it is YOU who are the fool! Ah ha! HAA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: You people and your cheap parlour
    tricks. (spits)
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: And live to suffer another day?
    What a cruel joke.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Bah. All this charity is making
    me ill.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: You think me weak, frivolous?  Hah!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: I suffered much indignation
    at Court - I've a taste for it now.
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: Stop touching me!
  jester+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: I prefer only a certain variety
    of poisons, thank you.
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: No. I've PRAYED for death. I've LONGED
    for it!
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: "(chuckle) You WANT more misery? You
    sadist! TORTURER!"
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: Hee heee heeeeeee! Hee-hee! HEEEEEE!
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: HA HAAAA!
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: I prefer being stabbed over hearing
    you whine in the tavern.
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Getting beaten and humiliated is
    sort of my job. (sad laugh)
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: What, did you make a bet that we'd fail?
  jester+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: "... You're leading us into a trap!
    Clever, but I must decline."
  jester+str_block_heal_depressed_0: No. One fewer soul will do the world some good.
  jester+str_block_heal_depressed_1: Go. You don't want me around anyway.
  jester+str_block_heal_depressed_2: Save your arts for someone with a spark of hope.
  jester+str_block_heal_irrational_0: HAR HARR HAAARRRR!
  jester+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Eeee-hee heeeee!
  jester+str_block_heal_irrational_2: BWAH HA HAAA!
  jester+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Why bother? There will only be more later.
  jester+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: Your honest positivity is positively annoying.
  jester+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: Stop touching me! Go bother someone else!
  jester+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Pfft. Like as not, you'll just make things worse.
  jester+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: And infect the wound? You must think me a fool.
  jester+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Ha! Medicine! Parlour tricks, more like.
  jester+str_block_item_depressed_0: Why save an old maniac, of no use to anyone?
  jester+str_block_item_depressed_1: Just leave me here. I know you would relish my
    death.
  jester+str_block_item_irrational_0: AH-HOO HOO HOO!
  jester+str_block_item_irrational_1: "(cackling madly)"
  jester+str_block_item_masochistic_0: What reason is there for living, if not excruciating
    pain?
  jester+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Bah. Another day, another life-threatening
    injury.
  jester+str_block_item_paranoid_0: "... You try it first. I know poison when I see
    it."
  jester+str_block_item_paranoid_1: I would doubt me also, but I KNOW you're up to
    no good.
  jester+str_block_move_abusive_0: I don't like you right now. So piss off.
  jester+str_block_move_abusive_1: Mmmmmmmmm... no.
  jester+str_block_move_fearful_0: You pitiable fool! What use in scampering about!?
  jester+str_block_move_fearful_1: I cannot, lest I lose bowel control.
  jester+str_block_move_irrational_0: Ha! AH-HAA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_block_move_irrational_1: "(snorts)"
  jester+str_block_move_masochistic_0: Ah-ha! I'll stay here, and damn the odds!
  jester+str_block_move_masochistic_1: "(whining) But I won't get any fighting if
    I move there!"
  jester+str_block_move_paranoid_0: And leave me open to attack? Dear old me?
  jester+str_block_move_paranoid_1: "... I'll stay here. Go fool someone else."
  jester+str_buff_party_powerful_0: There is no escape from here... save to slay all.
  jester+str_buff_party_powerful_1: You must admit that wanton slaughter is a lot
    of fun...
  jester+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Good. Now you go first.
  jester+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Never been much of a leader, but
    I'll try... TALLY HO!
  jester+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: There is no "honor." You only seek to forestall
    shame.
  jester+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: Keep your pride. I'll have no part in it.
  jester+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Foolishness! There is no glory! It is a
    construct!
  jester+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: I won't be a punchline!
  jester+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Move aside!  I'm not dying for you or anyone!
  jester+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: What a horror!
  jester+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: This is no chance encounter! Someone wants
    us dead!
  jester+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: You watch -- our chances will slowly sour....
  jester+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: We are only MEANT to think them evil. They
    are being paid...
  jester+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Life is a fool's errand. So please, excuse
    me.
  jester+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Sacrifice is a most noble act. Here, see for
    yourself.
  jester+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: I've done more than enough for this 'expedition.'
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: We cling so pathetically to life. Is it ego
    or id?
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: It's you or me. Either works.
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Why endure this world? We all have a choice.
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Hoooo hoooooo hooooooooo!
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: "(maniacal cackling)"
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Ah-ha ha HAAAAA!
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Heh heh here we go!
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: An eye for an eye, me chappy?
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: I'll trade you! Slice for slice!
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Well, let me have a piece or two!
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Oh, how I do love a pitiable scream.
  jester+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: Suppose I'll have to work for my living...
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Enough flailing and the job gets done,
    apparently.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: Incredible. You hit one. Finally.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: "(mad chuckling)"
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Eh heh. Heh.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Yes, you do all the hard work. I approve.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: I'm taking a nap. Let me know when
    it's safe.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Good gods, get out of my way.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: I don't want to be here all daaaayyyyy!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: It knows we're easy targets. We
    are sad, pathetic fools!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Such hubris. We've practically
    killed ourselves!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: EEEEEEE heee heee heeeeeeee!
    HA HAAA!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: HAA HAAA HAAAAAAAA! HA! HA!!!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Ha! Only a traitor could have
    missed that shot!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: How did you miss? Tell me, before
    I cut the truth from you!
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: How the hell did you negotiate
    an equal share? Pffft.
  jester+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: Booooo! I want my money back!
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: LORD, just kill yourself already! So cruel
    to egg them on!
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: And here I thought I was the court jester.
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: I should never have come out here...
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: On second thought, children's birthdays aren't
    so bad...
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Heh. Heh-heh. Eh-hmmm....
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: A-HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! ... HAAA!
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Beautiful. Just beautiful...
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: As usual, I am passed over even for punishment.
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: They bleed poison! Do not let it touch you!
  jester+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Smell that? It is sulphur! They are demon-anointed!
  jester+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: RUN! RUUUUUUUUUN!
  jester+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: All your courage and your nobility...
    all for what?!
  jester+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: YAAA-HA-HA-HA-HAAAAAA!
  jester+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: "(snort)"
  jester+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: They missed. How convenient...
  jester+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: No... It's not possible they missed you.
    What's your game?
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: "(pained sobbing)"
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: "(whistling a weird tune)"
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Ha haaa haaaaaa! ... HAAA!
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Now here's an end worth singing about.
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Yes, don't leave me out. I deserve all
    I can get.
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: GAH! ... Whose idea was this?? HUH??
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: Are you all TRYING to get me killed??
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Okay, I've had enough! Try someone else!
  jester+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Few more hits and I'll require additional
    recompense!
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: "(shrill scream)"
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: It's after me! HEEELLLLP!
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: HOO HOO HOOOOOO!
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: AH-HEE HEE HEEEEE!
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: You pathetic creature. Can't even
    kill a suicidal clown.
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Go for the eyes next time.
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: I am done for! That one has it out for
    me!
  jester+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: I think this one rather dislikes me!
  jester+str_critbyhero_0: HA HA HAAAA!
  jester+str_critbyhero_1: Hee heee heeeeee!
  jester+str_critbyhero_2: HA!
  jester+str_critbyhero_3: AH-HA HA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_critbyhero_4: Truly amusing...
  jester+str_critbyhero_5: Slice, slice, slice!
  jester+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Insanity suits me, it seems.
  jester+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: Do I feel better, or is that just the pipe-weed?
  jester+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: "(giggles, sobs)"
  jester+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: What hogwash, this need to "live."
  jester+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: All cowards flail hopelessly against demise.
    Pity.
  jester+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Ah hah. You are mad as a hatter.
  jester+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: No. No, I think I shall stay here...
  jester+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: Are you insane!?
  jester+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: HOOO HOOO HAAA HAAAA HAAAAAAA!
  jester+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Off with his head! Ha-haaa!
  jester+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: "(annoying guffawing)"
  jester+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: I admire your guile, but I am immune to scheming.
  jester+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: Directly into the snapping jaws of death?
    Ha!
  jester+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: Yes, feed the jester to the dogs. A common
    scheme.
  jester+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: No. I am content. ... Bwah!
  jester+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: Not at the moment. I am... busy.
  jester+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: And what will you give me in return? Hmmmm?
  jester+str_mark_self_depressed_0: Is there one among you pitying enough to kill
    a fool?!
  jester+str_mark_self_depressed_1: No! Take me instead! I've had my fill of this
    life!
  jester+str_mark_self_irrational_0: AH HA HAAA HAAAAAAA!
  jester+str_mark_self_irrational_1: HOO HOOOOOOOO!
  jester+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: GAH! Just KILL ME and be done with it!
  jester+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: HA HA HAAAAAA!
  jester+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: It shows me my death! Pain... such horrible
    pain!
  jester+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: You think you know evil. And then...
  jester+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: It reflects our hatred back at us!
  jester+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Hah! The joke's on me then...?
  jester+str_random_command_abusive_0: I am sick of sitting backstage!
  jester+str_random_command_abusive_1: My performance begins!
  jester+str_random_command_abusive_2: Can you even carry a tune, let alone a sword?
  jester+str_random_command_depressed_0: Why struggle so? It's all just meat and shame.
  jester+str_random_command_depressed_1: Too late. I gave up on us hours ago.
  jester+str_random_command_depressed_2: Why have we not surrendered yet?
  jester+str_random_command_irrational_0: "(mad giggling)"
  jester+str_random_command_irrational_1: HA HAAA HAAAAAAA!
  jester+str_random_command_irrational_2: MWAH-HA HA HA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_random_command_masochistic_0: By all means, if suicide is your plan...
  jester+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Ha! You want to see foolhardy? Then shove
    over!
  jester+str_random_command_masochistic_2: If suicide is your plan, then I am your
    man.
  jester+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I'll play the fool no longer!
  jester+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Trick the master trickster?! HAA HAA HAAAAA!
  jester+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Who said that?!
  jester+str_random_command_selfish_0: Fie. An idiot's work is never done.
  jester+str_random_command_selfish_1: LA LA LA, I canst barely hear you! ... Hee-heeee!
  jester+str_random_command_selfish_2: Huh? My apologies, I misunderstood. ... Heh.
  jester+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: It's a sad day when I am your best hope.
  jester+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Here, clean your wounds with this whiskey.
    I have lots.
  jester+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: Blast. Seems I'll see tomorrow after all.
  jester+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: What a joke. Positively hilarious.
  jester+str_virtued_courageous_0: Be calmed. We shall live to suffer another day.
  jester+str_virtued_courageous_1: A pathetic joke, this place. Court is infinite
    worse.
  jester+str_virtued_focused_0: My blade will find their weaknesses!
  jester+str_virtued_focused_1: They squeal like pigs! Must silence them!
  jester+str_virtued_powerful_0: Ha haaa! Ha haa haaaaa! HAA HAAAAAAA!
  jester+str_virtued_powerful_1: EEEEEEE-HEEE HEEE HEEEEEE!!!
  jester+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Madness or willpower. Either works.
  jester+str_virtued_stalwart_1: I care not. And so I am immortal.
  jester+str_virtued_vigorous_0: If your foul reek hasn't killed me yet, nothing will.
  jester+str_virtued_vigorous_1: I've lived at court. Poison no longer has any effect.
leper:
  leper+str_afflicted_abusive_0: The human race is a litter; these, the runts.
  leper+str_afflicted_abusive_1: They rush, these lemmings, to the cliff's edge...
  leper+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Even dogs know when the meat is tainted...
  leper+str_afflicted_abusive_3: You fight death like a child fights aging.
  leper+str_afflicted_abusive_4: Yes... pray. What we need now is more noise.
  leper+str_afflicted_depressed_0: A crack in the chamber room window. Snow swirls
    in...
  leper+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Cobwebs in the dining hall. Weevils in the crust!
  leper+str_afflicted_depressed_2: The blade is broken.
  leper+str_afflicted_depressed_3: Even steel may shatter in the cold.
  leper+str_afflicted_depressed_4: We march only to ruin.
  leper+str_afflicted_fearful_0: A tunnel carved in ice. A guttering torch.
  leper+str_afflicted_fearful_1: Swarms of summer larks, fleeing the autumn wind.
  leper+str_afflicted_fearful_2: All must come to ruin. There is no escape.
  leper+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Do not resist the end. Anguish is the sure result.
  leper+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Now we come to it... The vision is cloaked in black.
  leper+str_afflicted_irrational_0: "(desperate gasping and gurgling)"
  leper+str_afflicted_irrational_1: Grey seven apple-court in Autumn. Battle-born.
  leper+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Where what blade throne calls under winter.
  leper+str_afflicted_irrational_3: I sailing-ship course. Wander heaven thrice!
  leper+str_afflicted_irrational_4: "(incoherent moaning)"
  leper+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: She eats only what she makes, the ailing dowager.
  leper+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: 'To the lizard, it is clear: sacrifice or death.'
  leper+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Pain is an affectation. Only death is real.
  leper+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Carve away the numb flesh and expose the man
    within.
  leper+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: The dead long for torture -- to FEEL once more!
  leper+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Lions in the savanna. A lone campfire.
  leper+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Red rubies glitter in the trove of night.
  leper+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: A white rabbit. Heart pounding, limbs ablaze...
  leper+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: We are not alone here.
  leper+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: They will come for us soon. It is inevitable.
  leper+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Alms for the sick?
  leper+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Ants at a spring picnic. Wine spilled in the heath.
  leper+str_afflicted_selfish_2: I fight at the fore. Who better to lead a suicide-charge?
  leper+str_afflicted_selfish_3: All cloth we scavenge goes to me. I have needs...
  leper+str_afflicted_selfish_4: Give me your spoils - I suffer more hardship than
    you can know!
  leper+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: I'll not waste my last days at your side! Perish!
  leper+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: Another fool for the Reaper. Sigh.
  leper+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: Amber knick-knacks glow nightly. Abroad
    in the beam.
  leper+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: Passage for buttercups. Slip into dream-state.
    Worship.
  leper+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: There are few things so dangerous as a trusted
    ally.
  leper+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: The noose-rope has two ends, my "good friend."
  leper+str_attack_self_depressed_0: I've fought and fought... and for what?
  leper+str_attack_self_depressed_1: I delude myself, that there is honor in suffering.
  leper+str_attack_self_irrational_0: Cold wayfarers, eating dishonored. Brains on
    the hearth.
  leper+str_attack_self_irrational_1: Cherry blossom axe heads. Raking the dead. Fielding
    fire.
  leper+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: That tendon was doing me little good anyway.
  leper+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: I am not afraid of pain. Quite the opposite.
  leper+str_bark_deathsdoor: An end to my torment, at last?
  leper+str_bark_encourage_0: 'I know this one thing: survival is a state of mind.'
  leper+str_bark_encourage_1: The sun always rises. Evil cannot even stall it.
  leper+str_bark_encourage_2: Perseverance is power. Remember that.
  leper+str_bark_first_aid_0: I know my way around a wound. Now bite on this.
  leper+str_bark_first_aid_1: You cannot die from this. I know.
  leper+str_bark_first_aid_2: You will survive. I can see it in your eyes.
  leper+str_bark_hobby_0: Here we sit, the calm in the eye of the storm.
  leper+str_bark_hobby_1: I must be cautious when stretching my ligaments, lest they
    tear, of course.
  leper+str_bark_hobby_2: Pass this pipe around. The smoke dulls the senses.
  leper+str_bark_pep_talk_0: If I've survived this long, so can you all.
  leper+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Do not dwell on your end. Think instead of today.
  leper+str_bark_pep_talk_2: Wine, song, naked feet. Fresh dew in springtime.
  leper+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: You are a crack in crystal - profaning the precious!
  leper+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: You worm. Crawl from the mud and die in the rain!
  leper+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Pathetic little things. Fighting unto your end.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Light, kill me in my sleep. Spare me these
    fools.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: My companions somehow smell worse than my
    bandages...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Huh. They let anyone carry a weapon these
    days.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: The wind cannot stop. It blows forever...
    Immortal.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Shall I never be free of this mortal coil?
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: I feel it... tomorrow shall be my last.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: Hot breath and blood-stained ivory...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: The bountiful glen pales before the death-chill...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: We should keep moving. The enemy is close...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Hinterland prison death-march. Blanket
    all the land.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: Rage begets springtime. Cold essays on
    murder.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Augustine hearth-fire maidens, farm and
    forge. Yes.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: If I sleep at the edge, they'll take me
    first...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: Fire... Fire might burn away the pain...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: How I long to cut away this corrupted
    flesh...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: The sky itself knows not where lightning
    may strike.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: "... They know I am ill. They will try to
    trick me..."
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: If they let me die, their percentage increases...
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Pass the drink. My sores need cleansing.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Now... I must rest. Please keep quiet.
  leper+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Silence! I need rest to maintain my strength!
  leper+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: No sparrow lives that cannot fly.
  leper+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: Blood and rain in the muddy bootprints...
  leper+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: Just one more suicide mission... one more...
  leper+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Mists on the moor! Shadows marshaling in the gloom!
  leper+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: Now it comes to it, I am not ready for release!
  leper+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: Take me quickly. I have suffered overlong.
  leper+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: Yearn cobra in elder days. A forest of black.
  leper+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Iron sleeps in sunshine. Grey. Redemptive.
  leper+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Standard bearer sleeps cold moorland. Blazing
    charge.
  leper+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: I was a soldier. I've a long acquaintance with
    pain.
  leper+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Work quickly. I wish to depart soon.
  leper+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: You can do nothing worse than what nature has
    already done.
  leper+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: Watch our flanks. They will attempt a pincer attack.
  leper+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Good sailors obey the rats; the captain, only
    sometimes.
  leper+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: There must be more of them... stay watchful.
  leper+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: I've been sold a river, and yet I go thirsty...
  leper+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: They gave me the reins. But where is my warhorse?
  leper+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: There ought to be a bonus for the senior heroes...
  leper+str_block_buff_depressed_0: You have no pity. Just let me go.
  leper+str_block_buff_depressed_1: You would help a sick man to suffer in anguish...
  leper+str_block_buff_depressed_2: You prune the ivy, though it is almost February.
  leper+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Nine-fold gateways lurk topside. In light. In
    dark.
  leper+str_block_buff_irrational_1: The hatchways burn. Cover her head. Feathers.
    Death.
  leper+str_block_buff_irrational_2: Elaborate scripture. The enormity of calligraphy.
  leper+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: You have not learned... I LONG to die in battle!
  leper+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: Save your efforts. Nothing rejuvenates like
    pain.
  leper+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: My spirit is immune to this treatment. I need
    pain.
  leper+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: I must rely only on myself...
  leper+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: If magic was real, would I be in this sorry state?
  leper+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: No... Willpower alone will carry me through.
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I feel the end coming. I go to it willingly...
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: No. I must go to my end in a pure state.
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Stand down, potter. Knife seance blathering
    moonlight.
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: Cold cathedral wanders reservoir. Light
    ripple deeps.
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: As long as my belly hungers, my blood
    flows.
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Yearning begets yearning. And I yearn
    for victory.
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: This will put an end to all of us. Is that
    your plan?
  leper+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: There's no need to hasten me demise. I'll
    go soon enough.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Bright as the sun, feeble as
    the worm. Sigh...
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Come again? You could not possibly
    be so foolish.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: "... You do have military training,
    yes? ... Oh my."
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: Why tempt the inevitable? It
    will come in time.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: You seek glory? It is a mad
    game. A drunken dance.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: There is little difference
    between survival and greed.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: A white star, alone in the night-strong
    void.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: Such darkness... such darkness...
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: The animal is still. Like a corpse.
    Awed by death.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: Black rain wonder seven tide.
    On the moorhead.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: Go forth, flustermuffin. Fruit
    and beggars and bastards.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Call down rage on glory. Betwixt
    the haze and teatime.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Come now. Nothing can prevent
    death.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Why not embrace death instead?
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: You seek to forestall the
    inevitable. And I sympathize.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: "...the endless tintinnabulation
    of funeral bells..."
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: A lonely snowflake, last to
    go before the rising...
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: They have us. It is only a matter
    of time.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: There is better time to use that.
    I will let you know.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: I have done enough. It is soon
    time to rest.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: Blazes of glory don't come cheap,
    you know...
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Enough!  Let me be, blaggart!
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: Just sit down. I do not need your
    nursemaiding.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Tend the dying tree all you like.
    It still goes to seed.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Gold is worth nothing at the bottom
    of the sea.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: My pain alone shall be my protection.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: No. I must keep my head clear
    of distractions.
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: Why would you seek to extend my
    pain?
  leper+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: I don't need your pity. Nor anyone's.
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: No. My end has come and passed a hundred
    times.
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: I... I can take no more joy, no pain.
    I've had my fill.
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: Jupiter bleating, my ghoulish sundial.
    Fare so long and high.
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: Grander long time, rage and sorrow.
    Seven is right. Now!
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: No. Every fresh wound erases my memory
    of the last.
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Though it burns the eyes, is the sun
    not beautiful?
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: Sorry, friend. I'll not let you besmirch
    my honor so.
  leper+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: You've wanted us to fail all along. I
    saw it in your eyes.
  leper+str_block_heal_depressed_0: You pretend to value my company. But I see the
    truth.
  leper+str_block_heal_depressed_1: No. Leave me to my cursed fate.
  leper+str_block_heal_depressed_2: If you want to help, just end my suffering.
  leper+str_block_heal_irrational_0: Under mountain passes the fold. Lovely. Lovely.
  leper+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Blade rot ramparts. Straw-white in the window.
  leper+str_block_heal_irrational_2: Grass in the ice fields.  Adrift in the clouds.
  leper+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: No. I'd be nothing without the pain.
  leper+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: I live in constant pain - it is a part of me!
  leper+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: Don't you see that I am grateful for the pain?
  leper+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: You seek to prolong my life? What cruelty is this?!
  leper+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: I doubt you have the needed expertise. No one does...
  leper+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Poor foragers must know their mushrooms well...
  leper+str_block_item_depressed_0: There's no point in easing my pain.
  leper+str_block_item_depressed_1: I have lived on the edge of death for years. Why
    fight now?
  leper+str_block_item_irrational_0: The flesh weakens and crumbles away!
  leper+str_block_item_irrational_1: Dust and wind and paradise beyond the gate.
  leper+str_block_item_masochistic_0: Pay me no mind, child. Death is only an inconvenience.
  leper+str_block_item_masochistic_1: No thank you, I barely feel it.
  leper+str_block_item_paranoid_0: You seem to extend my suffering? How cruel.
  leper+str_block_item_paranoid_1: You do me a great indignity. Perhaps that is your
    wish...
  leper+str_block_move_abusive_0: Incompetence and idealism are not so very different...
  leper+str_block_move_abusive_1: Only a coward requires perfection.
  leper+str_block_move_fearful_0: Nay. My firm stance is all I have left.
  leper+str_block_move_fearful_1: Stop running about. Accept death with grace.
  leper+str_block_move_irrational_0: Feel cold temple stone, wooden and rifled. Blade
    awakens.
  leper+str_block_move_irrational_1: Now approach winter and stone-setting, silvered
    and rotten.
  leper+str_block_move_masochistic_0: Begone. I depart soon, and I have chosen this
    spot.
  leper+str_block_move_masochistic_1: Leave me to my death. Here, it shall come quickly.
  leper+str_block_move_paranoid_0: The constant pursuit of the ideal situation is
    a sin.
  leper+str_block_move_paranoid_1: The chain is only so strong as its weakest link...
  leper+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Power is the gift of fearlessness. It is always
    so.
  leper+str_buff_party_powerful_1: No death for you today, save that which you sow.
  leper+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Your warrior soul blooms. A wildflower
    after a fire.
  leper+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: You have the killing eye. Turn it
    towards our victory.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I have stolen the place of youth and power.
    I recede.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: Even the mighty bear must flee a coming storm.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: The sun sets e'er the gloom of night...
  leper+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: At the press of twilight, the sun flees.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Even mighty summer yields to awesome winter.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Deer before the forest fire...
  leper+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: The smell of my sickness attracted them. This
    is my fault.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: I am like blood in the water to them. I endanger
    the mission.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: I know them. From a battle long ago... They
    have come for me.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: It is not my time. Soon, though.
  leper+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I cannot die now! The stars, they... are not
    aligned!
  leper+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Death is inevitable. I'm just... postponing
    it.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: My last ounce of bravery. It spills out, bloody.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: The dam breaks. Life flows, reckless, enraged.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Death would be a most blissful freedom.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Pound severed in the abattoir! Betray the
    morning star!
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: Return of Spring. Call down the galleons.
    Nightly.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Rage in the armory. Sell-swords bargain.
    Inheritance.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Yessss... cut away the dead meat. Search
    out my soul.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: A moth unto Flame!
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: I have a few lives left to burn...
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Death is inevitable. But the cause is my choice
    alone.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: I will die here. Move aside.
  leper+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: My time has come.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Hmm. With training, you might prove
    competent.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: There are better ways to fill a teacup
    than with a storm...
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Wool pepper drives the whirling
    sou'wester. Mmm. Yes.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Caution bans the twilight, hammer-like.
    Summon the fish.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Good. Clearly, there's no need to overexert
    myself.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: You fight well. Handle things while
    I take a rest.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: You do not paint a flattering picture
    of your kind...
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: When we're done here, I'll teach
    you how to fight properly.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: No... This is NOT how it's supposed
    to end.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Vultures know our names. They have
    staked us out...
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: Tidings told in the half-twilight.
    Leeches gambol amidships.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: Helen is beholden, barrow-ward.
    Call to her. Say "liar."
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Are you hiding booze? You must
    be drunk to miss like that!
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: I think our ally is keeping secrets
    from us...
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Stand aside. This one is meant only
    for me... I can feel it.
  leper+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: You should leave this one to the
    soldiers.
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: As wheat from the chaff...
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: So many weeds in the garden. Tsk tsk tsk...
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: One step too far... one step and it's all
    over...
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Here it is. The end of my time. Finally...
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Threading the weave, flounder cold in the
    yellowing.
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: Fish oil wasted on the ramparts. Slime
    down the abbey.
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: No mercy for the cripple, I see. SIGH.
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: Let me fight that one! So bloody and savage...
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: The end is upon us. I go with a tranquil
    mind.
  leper+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: The death-bell tolls for us... Soon now.
  leper+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: I rather had hoped to die in victory...
  leper+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: Good news is, it'll be a quick end.
  leper+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Hinder maypole's cinder blossom. Break
    aside for galleons.
  leper+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Sunder the hinterlands. Call for a hero.
    Brazen teapot!
  leper+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: Even I could not have dodged that blow...
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: "(gritting teeth) It cuts... too deep. To
    the fire within."
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: How I have longed to die... And yet now I
    long to survive.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: Yonder blights call the mist. In the black
    heather.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Bleak lands fall seaside, and mares despair
    of time.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Each wound takes me closer to bliss.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Yes. Relieve me of this life. Do it.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: They know all my maneuvers. As if trained
    for them...
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: You wait. More will come.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: I have limited blood. Let us spend it... wisely.
  leper+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: My time is short. Let us not waste it.
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Gods! Don't let it touch me!
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: Bloody cretin has my scent!
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: Lemongrass and honey. Goose, apples,
    bread-beer. Milk.
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Blackened balustrades. The foxes hunt
    the dogs.
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: And life trudges onward, oblivious
    and stubborn.
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: The fire takes the grass, but spares
    the rotting elm.
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: They turn against me. They know I am weak.
  leper+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: I am blood in the water...
  leper+str_critbyhero_0: Blood in the mud.
  leper+str_critbyhero_1: Petals must fall.
  leper+str_critbyhero_2: Rain in the forest.
  leper+str_critbyhero_3: Summer before the Fall.
  leper+str_critbyhero_4: Fog before sunrise.
  leper+str_critbyhero_5: The tide rises. And the tide falls.
  leper+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: I suppose I must be grateful, to go on surviving.
  leper+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: Sigh. And so my soul stubbornly clings to life.
  leper+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: I will not. Blame me if you like. I am expendable.
  leper+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: I die soon, yet I hold out for a more glorious
    end.
  leper+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: I have lived long. But have I lived well?
  leper+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Even the mighty tiger is wary of the cobra.
  leper+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: You take advantage of my death wish. For shame.
  leper+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: I may be doomed, but I'm not suicidal.
  leper+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Twilight culture. Smell it. Orchids have
    meat.
  leper+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Swamp in the heather. Summon the grapefruit
    cavalry.
  leper+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Henceforth the lark. Rendezvous with the
    manoeuvre.
  leper+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: The hare knows wherefore the fox stalks...
  leper+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: No. I must be ready to defend the flanks.
  leper+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: The mouse scampers, but the owl senses trickery...
  leper+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: Though doomed, I'll not spend this life thoughtlessly!
  leper+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: Only if you agree to a state funeral.
  leper+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: A poor tactic. Let me think of a better one...
  leper+str_mark_self_depressed_0: Empty shells rolling in the surf! ALL EMPTY!
  leper+str_mark_self_depressed_1: There is no glory. But there is death! COME, VILLAINS!
  leper+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Blade rakes and tines. Field the war-children.
  leper+str_mark_self_irrational_1: Separate the tree. Abolish the reign of coastlines.
  leper+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Pain and pleasure... in equal measure.
  leper+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Hurt me. Make me FEEL again!
  leper+str_mark_self_masochistic_2: Come join my dance -- I and the Reaper.
  leper+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: It whispers of my death. But I know it well.
  leper+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: Helpless souls! It binds them to its
    will!
  leper+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: I can hear its soul! Screaming out in pain!
  leper+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Spare the others, I am ready.
  leper+str_random_command_abusive_0: Shame!
  leper+str_random_command_abusive_1: I am the fury of an empire!
  leper+str_random_command_abusive_2: "... You know, I could recommend a good war
    college."
  leper+str_random_command_depressed_0: Our plans have failed. My fate is mine alone.
  leper+str_random_command_depressed_1: I would prefer to die this way. Thank you.
  leper+str_random_command_depressed_2: No... No, the moment is lost.
  leper+str_random_command_irrational_0: Gather winds nighttime journey. Ration wheat.
  leper+str_random_command_irrational_1: Mead and forgery. Barter for the goat. Midwives.
  leper+str_random_command_irrational_2: Solemn burn catch the rugged breeze. Nighttime
    elated.
  leper+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Please... I grow weary of hope.
  leper+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Ants marching blindly towards the spider's
    trap.
  leper+str_random_command_masochistic_2: I tire of these formalities. Let me die
    now.
  leper+str_random_command_paranoid_0: The owl hunts alone.
  leper+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Cross paths with the panther and beware.
  leper+str_random_command_paranoid_2: You all mock me?  I reject it!
  leper+str_random_command_selfish_0: I have dispensed with captains. For now I go
    alone.
  leper+str_random_command_selfish_1: The slave soon covets his master's power.
  leper+str_random_command_selfish_2: Let me show you something of my experience.
  leper+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: Wounds do not disturb me. Let me wash
    them.
  leper+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: My suffering has granted me a modicum
    of power...
  leper+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: The snow-bells bloom in January.
  leper+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: The sun is brightest after darkest night.
  leper+str_virtued_courageous_0: We have become as steel.
  leper+str_virtued_courageous_1: Mountains defy the consuming sea.
  leper+str_virtued_focused_0: The storm infuriates the sea...
  leper+str_virtued_focused_1: The honeybee to his nectar, by the queen's command.
  leper+str_virtued_powerful_0: A river-dragon in the heart of the ocean.
  leper+str_virtued_powerful_1: Nothing stands in the path of an avalanche.
  leper+str_virtued_stalwart_0: The blackest night yields to brightest dawn.
  leper+str_virtued_stalwart_1: A glorious end is upon us.
  leper+str_virtued_vigorous_0: The death-cap grows -- thrives -- in the shade.
  leper+str_virtued_vigorous_1: The reaper is well known to me. I do not fear him.
man_at_arms:
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_abusive_0: To me, weaklings!  Watch and learn!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_abusive_1: Am I the only one here who has been in battle?!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Truth is, most of you won't survive this.
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_abusive_3: You are like a gaggle of pathetic recruits!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_abusive_4: Incompetent fools!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_depressed_0: I cannot bear the weight of keeping you all
    alive.
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_depressed_1: When did I become Death's right hand?
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_depressed_2: I am a dull weapon wielded by the wicked
    hand of Fate!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_depressed_3: I am haunted by visions of my betrayed men!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_depressed_4: I knew only to follow orders! Forgive me
    brothers!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_fearful_0: H-how flawed, my strategy!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_fearful_1: We must fall back! We must retreat!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_fearful_2: The classic strategems elude me!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Retreat, damn you! RETREAT!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Turn back, we are too far!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_irrational_0: The flutes! Can no one else hear them?!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_irrational_1: My stitches whisper recipes for the most
    delicious stew!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Someone has stolen my third hand!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_irrational_3: The ball of my mace reflects the fires of
    Hell...
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_irrational_4: How curious you can see me, for I am long
    dead.
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Let the blows fall! Strategy is born in
    blood!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: Another scar is no difference!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: The sting of injury dulls the grief for
    my brothers!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Wounds are the wages of battle, and I LIKE
    to get paid!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: The searing pain is a most invigorating
    fire!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Dissenters - you spoil my tactics!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Eyes down, Private!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: They aim to sneak up on us!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Cowards! Finks! Underminers! You are revealed!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Treachery in the ranks!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Don't you dare forget who has been keeping
    us all alive!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Maybe I'll reveal my strategems, maybe I won't.
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_selfish_2: I am the backbone of this unit!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_selfish_3: I am the ranking officer!
  man_at_arms+str_afflicted_selfish_4: They think I am old and cannot count my coin.
    Fools.
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: Back to your place in formation!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: Out of my way! Don't trip me up!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_abusive_2: The rod is a dog's best tutor!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: There is an imp on your shoulder!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: I command you to be struck by me!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Perhaps this will encourage loyalty!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: I see demons peering from behind your
    eyes!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_2: Traitorous viper!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_depressed_0: Why can't I just finish it?!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Let my body feed the soil.
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_irrational_0: This mace is too dull, see?
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_irrational_1: I will require additional armour.
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_irrational_2: You have just witnessed the ultimate strategem!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: If you won't inspire me then I will!
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Just had to pop my shoulder back into
    place.
  man_at_arms+str_attack_self_masochistic_2: Ahhh! That's it!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_encourage_0: This formation, yes!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_encourage_1: To the line! TO THE LINE!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_encourage_2: Remember the drills and we will see this through!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_first_aid_0: It isn't much but you should pull through.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_first_aid_1: Take this, works a charm.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_first_aid_2: I'm no physician but this should steady you.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_hobby_0: Leave me to reflect on the day's battles.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_hobby_1: How did that one blow slip past my guard..?  I must
    think...
  man_at_arms+str_bark_hobby_2: I learned to carve during the lulls of the Cyprian
    campaign.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_pep_talk_0: We are strong together, hold fast!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_pep_talk_1: You execute maneuvers well!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_pep_talk_2: Stick to the plan and we will survive.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: And to think I hold the line for you pukes!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Go on! Trip and fall on your own swords!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: You would scatter like corpseflies if it
    wasn't for my drilling!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Which of you imbeciles has taken up
    smoking dung?
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: I wonder how many of you curs think
    you have truly earned this rest.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Your snoring distracts my planning!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: It is clear we are not made to survive
    this place.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: I am not fit to lead you.  Leave me
    here to die.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: This is the grave I deserve, buried
    in the sins of war.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_3: My tactics are ill suited to this
    place.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: I have marched in dark campaigns, but
    this...
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: The shades of those I have slain will
    not let me sleep.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: The fire sputters and dims, like my
    spirit.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Our mouths are filled with soldiers
    holding spears of bone.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: My skin is the only bedroll I need.  But
    I might take yours if it gets cold.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: I sold my other eye to pay for this
    lovely belt.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: No tailor can rival me for stitching
    my own flesh.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: I pray the battle is even bloodier
    on the morrow.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: I study my wounds, I learn new tactics.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: Tonight, I sleep with one eye open.  Heh.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: I will slay anyone who moves against
    me this night.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Am I to lie beside scheming vipers?
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_3: Better to strike first against those
    who would betray you.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Let me rest so I can save your worthless
    hides on the morrow.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Pray I am still here to guide you when
    you awaken.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Quit moaning, left you plenty of stew.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: I feel like I am but a child playing soldier.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: What palsy rattles my shield? Is this the
    end?
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: I should have died with my brothers!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: What devilish mind shapes their strategy?
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: I cannot recognize their tactics! What comes?!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: My mind is blank! How will I counter them?!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: The creaks of my armor mutter such ribald
    verses.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: One skin for water, another for grog,
    or perhaps a skull will do...
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: Someone help take off this flesh, I wish
    to fly!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: A day without pain is a day unlived!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Hah, that woke me up!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: I was counting on you to strike me!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: You louts willfully spoil my manuevers!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Best you aim your weapons away from my back.
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: Do my own cohorts conspire with the enemy?
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Oh you can hold the line yourself then? Best
    I take that!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: I have the most stitches, I'll take the greatest
    share!
  man_at_arms+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: Give that here, for I am the shield between
    you and the grave!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_depressed_0: A reminder of how weak I truly am.
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_depressed_1: Despair infects everything in this place.
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_depressed_2: Save it for those who will survive.
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Your fingers drip with maggots!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Not too close, I have just passed wind.
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_irrational_2: Hush! I hear my missing eye calling!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: That would taint the sweet smell of my
    blood!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: There is no glory in witchcraft and strange
    charms!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Each wound earned is a lesson learned.
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: This is jiggery pokery, be off!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: I will use my own, thank you!
  man_at_arms+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: It is not a question of trust, but a matter
    of survival.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I have no will to eat.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: My stomach is knotted with despair.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: I only eat food that has distinguished
    itself in battle!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: My teeth marched off yesterday,
    perhaps some gruel instead?
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: I would save myself for the feast
    of our return!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: Hunger keeps me sharp on the field.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: Poison is said to be the worst way
    to die.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: More craven attempts from my cohorts.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Don't waste my time!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Would it end your whinging?
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: There is no balm for cowardice.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: I would only make things
    worse.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: I must reflect on my
    deeds.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Begone, I cannot help.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: My mind obsesses over my
    last defeat.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: My will flees from the
    terror of this place.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: It takes my entire being
    not to flee this place!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: What cockledoodledoo
    is this?
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: My mace disagrees, and
    I agree with it.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: Already dead!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: A wounded soldier fights
    with more vigor.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Strive to become one
    with your pain!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: I cannot deny you such
    a delicious experience.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: I will not help those
    who seek to undermine me.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: Not now, we are surrounded!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: So one of you can slip
    a knife in my back?
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: I am busy with planning!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: No gain in it for me!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: Never disturb an officer.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Back, clumsy oaf!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: Vex me not with such insistence!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: Pointless and inefficient.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: No cure for this cursed
    old fool.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: It screams at us from the
    very centre of the universe!
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: You really can't hear them,
    can you?
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: I use the hurt to embolden
    my tactics.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: No finer muse than pain.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: A viper's usury is demanded
    in blood.
  man_at_arms+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: The gall to try this to my
    face!
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: This old soldier knows this is
    his final skirmish.
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: The omens are poor. We are finished
    either way.
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: I have never seen such maneuvers!
    I would stay!
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: It is rude to interrupt an officer's
    strategem.
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Finally a battle worthy of us
    and you lot want to slink away!
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Not until I have drunk my fill
    of this battle!
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: Retreat? We will walk right into
    their trap!
  man_at_arms+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: Don't you see that this is what
    they want?!
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_depressed_0: Nothing can cure the disease of Time.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_depressed_1: I am not meant to continue.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_depressed_2: I would rejoin my departed brothers.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_irrational_0: Get your hands off of me, I am promised
    to another!
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Kindly examine my wounded mace instead.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_irrational_2: They would not approve.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: All this soldier needs is a nip of brandy,
    thank you.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: By numbing the pain, I ignore the lesson
    of the blow.
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: No need for stitches yet!
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: So eager to heal me?
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: This is medicine?!
  man_at_arms+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Such deception.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_depressed_0: Save it for one who has the will to survive
    this place.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_depressed_1: There is no salve for my guilty heart.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_irrational_0: Pfah, simple gravedirt is all I need.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_irrational_1: No no no no no no.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_masochistic_0: Pain is all I need.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Soldiers live to suffer!
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_paranoid_0: Of course I trust you... just leave me to
    my own affairs.
  man_at_arms+str_block_item_paranoid_1: These have been fouled by traitorous hands!
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_abusive_0: Such insubordination!
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_abusive_1: And where would the green recruit like me
    to stand?
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_fearful_0: I cannot avoid my destiny, this is my final
    stand.
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_fearful_1: This marks the spot where I die.
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_irrational_0: Not the time, not the season, not the hour,
    nor the reason!
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_irrational_1: My armor forbids it!
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_masochistic_0: And miss the sweet pain of battle?
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_masochistic_1: I am here to bleed, and bleed I shall.
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_paranoid_0: We are already surrounded, why hasten our
    end?
  man_at_arms+str_block_move_paranoid_1: From here I can see those who would betray
    me.
  man_at_arms+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Let us press together!
  man_at_arms+str_buff_party_powerful_1: They are exposed by our manoeuvers!
  man_at_arms+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Strike while they are exposed!
  man_at_arms+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Heed my strategem and you will
    crush them.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I am out of your way now.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: My position was ill-chosen.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: I cannot hold them back.  I cannot
    lead.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: We are exposed!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Fall back!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: We need to change formation!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_irrational_0: Ants!! My armor is full of ants!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_irrational_1: I saw the funniest dance the other
    day, can I show you?
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_irrational_2: This! This is the spot!  Bring me
    my shovel!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: Is no position safe?!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: I will not show my back to you cravens!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: One of you has betrayed us!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Of course this is part of the plan!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I can see more of the battle from there!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Someone else hold the line!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: I have naught to lose. I will shield
    you.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: This will be my last march.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Suicide? Perhaps.
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Retreat, NO - CHARGE! Hee hee...
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: I see my eye there as it sees me!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: The ground dances on my feet!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: I will gladly catch their blows!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: To the line! I live to bleed!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: One sweet wound is a sweeter stitching
    later!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: You cannot lead as I can!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: It is I who will guide us!
  man_at_arms+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: I suppose it falls to me to hold this
    position!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: You are attacking out of turn!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: You dolt, never attack without
    knowing the plan!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Why did you attack?!  Only
    peace can bring us through!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: You know the secret!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: I will decide who attacks whom!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: That was not my command!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: You will have to answer for
    that!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Cur! You gift them our very
    lives!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: Now it will slay us all!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: You stray from the plan!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: All part of the dance,
    all part of the dance...
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: I command we all be friends
    and explore this place together!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Who among us has disturbed
    your aim?!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: You have sided with our enemies!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: It all falls to me!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: I will show you how a true
    professional advances!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: I cannot say I will miss you, oaf.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: Fortune favours the brave, and spits
    on the coward.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Spare them! I cannot bear to lose more
    men!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: This place is saving me for last.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: The customs in this place are strange
    beyond words.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: The sharp things always find the
    soft things...
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: How my envy stirs!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: A wound is but a smile, depending
    on how you look at it.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: Because they know our plans!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: You play the victim to disguise your
    defection!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: They could finish us at any time!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: See how they taunt us!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Look at how the wind plays with
    us all.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: The old unwritten rule to never
    let the enemy miss.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: They warned you of their attack!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: It is said a viper will never strike
    another of its kin.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: All is becoming as I'd feared!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: My nightmares brought to life!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: Good! Now the ringing is back!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: That should do it!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: More! MORE!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Blood is battle's most savoury spice.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: They know my tactics!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: Impossible! There is a traitor!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: I require a bandage, NOW!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: They strike at the greatest threat!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Death creeps too slowly!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: I was frozen in place!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: Hah! Don't they know I'm a ghost?
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: A-la-la-dee and la-da-daaah!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Blazes, you were so close!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Damn, I moved the wrong way.
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: They have broken our formation!
  man_at_arms+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: They know my weaknesses!
  man_at_arms+str_critbyhero_0: Outmaneuvered!
  man_at_arms+str_critbyhero_1: Now that is a proper flanking!
  man_at_arms+str_critbyhero_2: A devil's due!
  man_at_arms+str_critbyhero_3: Perfectly executed!
  man_at_arms+str_critbyhero_4: This line will not break!
  man_at_arms+str_critbyhero_5: We hold as one and strike as one!
  man_at_arms+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Ah! My heart roars to serve alongside such
    stalwarts!
  man_at_arms+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: For a moment, my soul's guilt is lifted. For
    a moment...
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: Can I face every soldier's fate?
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: My heart is too heavy, my feet are made
    of lead.
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: After so many campaigns, now my spirit
    is defeated.
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Which maneuver? Which strategem?!
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: I am blind to the next move.
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: No! I could overextend myself!
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Hold still! Birds are nesting in our
    skulls!
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: I am caught in the spell of those damnable
    flutes...
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: My muscles follow another!
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: They know my plans!
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: Did you see them shift? We must hold
    fast!
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: Best I keep my plans from those who would
    betray me.
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: This is the best move ,for me.
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: A veteran knows when it is time to march
    and when it is time to rest.
  man_at_arms+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: This is part of my strategy, do not question
    me.
  man_at_arms+str_mark_self_depressed_0: Quickly, send me to my brothers!
  man_at_arms+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Better to die than suffer this regret I bear.
  man_at_arms+str_mark_self_irrational_0: I thirst and only mine own blood will do!
  man_at_arms+str_mark_self_irrational_1: I am stitching a design in my flesh, strike
    me here!
  man_at_arms+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Here devils! Strike me! STRIKE ME!
  man_at_arms+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: I lower my shield to invite more sport.
  man_at_arms+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: Is it to be my death? At long last?
  man_at_arms+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: I can hear the screams of my brothers!
  man_at_arms+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: Its evil nature defies my tactics!
  man_at_arms+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: I go with a clear conscience.
    I've given my all.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_abusive_0: I will keep my plan to myself, recruits.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_abusive_1: None of you have the right to order me.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_abusive_2: I don't need to justify my actions to
    you whelps.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_depressed_0: Here, or there it matters not.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_depressed_1: My experience deserts me in this place
    of despair.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_depressed_2: It doesn't matter what we do in this
    charnel house.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_irrational_0: Hup! 2-3-4!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_irrational_1: My tactics have taken us upstream the
    River of Time!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_irrational_2: And..NOW!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_masochistic_0: There is no thrill like the chaos
    of battle!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_masochistic_1: I invite my glorious end! Wound, by
    delicious wound!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_masochistic_2: The spirit of battle moves my limbs
    and guides my will!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_paranoid_0: Forgive me cohorts, I must move discreetly.
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_paranoid_1: This is the only way I can escape!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_paranoid_2: I cannot be betrayed if I am unpredictable!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_selfish_0: Give way to the commanding officer!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_selfish_1: When you have my experience, then you
    can shape the strategy!
  man_at_arms+str_random_command_selfish_2: This is how my plan must be executed!
  man_at_arms+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: It seems there are miracles, but
    I am no saint.
  man_at_arms+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Lean on me, you need not ask.
  man_at_arms+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: My brothers! I can feel their blessings!
  man_at_arms+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: Our cause unites us!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_courageous_0: Hah! Behind me! None shall pass!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_courageous_1: All into formation and we are made invincible!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_focused_0: Yes! Our victory is assured through these tactics!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_focused_1: I am one with my mace! I am one with my shield!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_powerful_0: I am forgiven! I am free!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_powerful_1: We are as one! None can stop us!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_stalwart_0: I was reborn through the blood and betrayal
    of my own kin!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Hear me brothers! I will redeem my debt!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_vigorous_0: I am your wall! Fear nothing!
  man_at_arms+str_virtued_vigorous_1: That's it! Upwards and onwards warriors!
musketeer:
  musketeer+str_afflicted_abusive_0: None of you could attend to my attendants!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_abusive_1: You jeopardize this hunt and I will have my prize!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_abusive_2: None of you are barely fit to feed the fire!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_abusive_3: A hunting party composed of rats and mules, how
    truly formidable!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_abusive_4: I wouldn't let you brush the dung from my boots!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_depressed_0: A life wasted stalking dumb beasts!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_depressed_1: I was never ready. I will die here, surely!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_depressed_2: Alas, my pride has snared me and hung me to
    dry!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_depressed_3: This is an impossible quarry!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_depressed_4: I am not the huntress I thought myself to be!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_fearful_0: My sights shiver, my blood stops!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_fearful_1: We are the prey!  This is their hunt!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_fearful_2: Horrors! Unclean sights!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_irrational_0: What is all of this, are we under the sea?!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_irrational_1: The hawks scream flags bearing my name!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_irrational_2: Squadrons of vikings! A field of battle!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_irrational_3: A cosmic flea! A cosmic joke!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_irrational_4: I can never die!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Pain! Make of me your quarry!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: My blood will lure them out!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: The thrill of the chase! The ecstacy of pain!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Sweet, oh sweetest agony!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Rend me! Gore me!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: Hah! One of you presumes to be able to stalk
    me!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: I sense a snake about!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Surround me if you dare!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: Something follows! It is near!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Which of you covets my skull for their mantel?!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_selfish_0: This is my hunt and woe if you forget that!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Be grateful! They may name you when they sing
    my songs!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_selfish_2: This expedition deserves a worthy leader! Me!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_selfish_3: Step aside, I have trained under those who survived
    the Lost Jungle!
  musketeer+str_afflicted_selfish_4: My attendants have outfitted me with the most
    lethal accoutrements!
  musketeer+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: Your incompetence threatens this expedition!
  musketeer+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: I will not stand for such insubordination!
  musketeer+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: I will not land in your pot, foul witch!
  musketeer+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: It would be unfair if you kept all the
    lizards!
  musketeer+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: Now you know better than to stalk the
    hunter!
  musketeer+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: I led you to believe that you were the
    one stalking me!
  musketeer+str_attack_self_depressed_0: Curses! Missed the jugular!
  musketeer+str_attack_self_depressed_1: My will has betrayed me and now my hands
    follow!
  musketeer+str_attack_self_irrational_0: Strange, the trumpets still sound...
  musketeer+str_attack_self_irrational_1: Just as it transpired in her crystal ball!
  musketeer+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: If only I had always known how to find
    such pleasure!
  musketeer+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: What a fine way to strengthen the will!
  musketeer+str_bark_encourage_0: Man will always triumph over beasts and their ilk!
  musketeer+str_bark_encourage_1: The trail ends, the prey is ours!
  musketeer+str_bark_encourage_2: Savage, unclean - these fiends hold no sway!
  musketeer+str_bark_first_aid_0: This little pot from my kit can heal most anything!
  musketeer+str_bark_first_aid_1: I am quick with the stitch, just hold still...
  musketeer+str_bark_first_aid_2: Father taught me this after one of the hounds bit
    me.
  musketeer+str_bark_hobby_0: My father can reload a musket as quick as a wink!
  musketeer+str_bark_hobby_1: When we return, I am certain the club will initiate
    me.
  musketeer+str_bark_hobby_2: Whoever smells like that should die of shame and disgrace.
  musketeer+str_bark_pep_talk_0: This is only a bit of excitement, think of the tales
    they'll tell!
  musketeer+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Think of how they'll cheer and toast us back in the
    Hamlet!
  musketeer+str_bark_pep_talk_2: This is the glory we have been hunting!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: There may be one among you who could shoulder
    my dead prey.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: I am suffocated by your doltish ways!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: A pack of blind apes would bring more to this
    fight!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Is that chewing tobacco? Charming.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: If you want to be of help then leave off!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: They will sing of my heroic perseverance
    despite you louts.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: I am not in the mood to natter.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Do me the kindness of slitting my throat
    as I sleep.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: Do you know of a poison that puts one
    into a morbid sleep?
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: Awake? Asleep? I am drowning in the ichor
    of nightmares!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Please do not let the fire die this night...
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: I will not stand watch alone! The shadows
    see us!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: Why are we sleeping? The sun is high!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: We must clean! My family arrives soon!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: It was a square glass, and it gleamed
    and spoke to me.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Who wants to change my stitches? No
    need to be gentle!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: No, not the stew! The salt is for
    my wounds!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: Of course it needs branding, lest
    it putrify.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: Handle me and I will wear your fingers
    as warning.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: My pouches are filled with bells to catch
    the craven.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: Deny it all you want! I can hear it approaching!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: I did not think you would mind if I had
    some extra.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Oh, dear me, I only brought enough for
    myself.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Your games and cheer keep me from sleep!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: I am worthless without my attendants!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: They smirked when I announced my expedition...
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: My death will besmirch my family's name and
    deeds.
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: It think it has been distracting us...from...
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: This is no sport, this is Hell itself!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: We have cornered prey no man was meant to hunt!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: This weird ruse can shoot flowers from a
    pipe!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: My heart quivers...could this be love?
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: It's in the trees!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Blood draws hunter and hunted, together!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: The clubsmen are soft from luxury! Pain
    forges me!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: I will stir its blood in mine!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: They taught me to be wary of those nearest,
    now I know why!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Surrounded! And there is no wall to protect
    my back!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: Where can I hide when I don't even know what
    hunts me?!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: If you could be so kind as to allow me to finish
    it...
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: As your leader I command you to follow my orders!
  musketeer+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: Occupy them, I ready the kill-shot!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Nothing will slow my pursuit of Death!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_depressed_1: But I am already dead!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_depressed_2: Doomed, I am doomed, do not pretend otherwise!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_irrational_0: Come back when you have a key for all these
    chains.
  musketeer+str_block_buff_irrational_1: I have plenty of bunnies, thank you.
  musketeer+str_block_buff_irrational_2: Lords and ladies, I cannot accept this.
  musketeer+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: I draw all the strength I need from this
    pain!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: Spilled blood fuels my will!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: It is as if my musket feeds on my blood...
  musketeer+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Will this weaken me so you can finally strike?
  musketeer+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: Ha! How foolish you must think I am!
  musketeer+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: Only if I can fire a ball into your craven
    heart.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: What strength have I to regain?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Perhaps you who still wish to breathe
    should eat first.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: As Queen of the Voles, I declare
    this meal is beneath me!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: Sharks swim in that bowl.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: I only take mine with wraith's pepper.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: A hunter is more keen on the fast.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: Is this traitor's stew? I'll pass.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: What a great 'kindness' you visit upon
    me...
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Let's save it for something
    actually worthwhile.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Has bumblebrains got themselves
    an owie?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Not everyone needs or deserves
    help, here.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: What a waste, we are all
    walking corpses now!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: I can tell you want to
    die, just as I do.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Why struggle against what
    is seen in our malefic stars?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: Trail?! There never was a
    trail! We hunt blindly in circles!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: I pray every moment that
    they will finish me quickly.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: Which is greater? The shame
    of quitting or the terror of Death itself?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: Hahahahahaha! HAHAHAHahaha!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: Why did the cockrel cross
    the lane?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: To reach the other side!
    Hahahahaha!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: Trust me love, you get
    used to it.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Only if you'll help me
    cut out these delicious stitches.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: You've still plenty left
    to bleed with, you'll see.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: I am not anyone's quarry!
    Be off!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: You seek to weaken me before
    battle!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: I know deception when I
    see it!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: I need to make sure there's
    enough for me.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: Well...my musket won't clean
    itself, dearie.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: This is a hunting expedition,
    not a nursery.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: Look here! A mummer who also
    knows physic!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: I would rather let an alley
    urchin treat me.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: If it won't hasten my end
    then be gone.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: So I can survive another day?
    I fear nothing worse.
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: Have you applied to gnome
    school before?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: I see you are entirely made
    of pebbles, how tragic!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: I...ah...uhm...ohhhh...
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: Is there any more salt in
    the provisions?
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: I knew it would be you to draw
    the dagger!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: Cross me at your peril!
  musketeer+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_2: Seeking to unburden your hands
    of their fingers?
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: You shall all die with me, drowning
    in despair!
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: The hunt is over, for all of us...
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: We cannot leave until the main
    course is served!
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: Fleeing this fleeting feeling fouls
    my very temper!
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: And flee pleasure? What madness
    is this?
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: I will teach you all how to savour
    this sweet misery!
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: Your hasty ways betray your disloyalty!
  musketeer+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: Cowards AND traitors, all of you!
  musketeer+str_block_heal_depressed_0: What am I to do without hope?
  musketeer+str_block_heal_depressed_1: Death's cold hand clutches at my heart.
  musketeer+str_block_heal_depressed_2: I am stepping into the grave.
  musketeer+str_block_heal_irrational_0: I saw a road winding backwards in a spiral,
    through the sea.
  musketeer+str_block_heal_irrational_1: The stars once spoke my name and then left.
  musketeer+str_block_heal_irrational_2: All things are made of ash and longing.
  musketeer+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Do not interrupt my pleasure!
  musketeer+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: I pity you, oblivious to such easy delights!
  musketeer+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: No...leave...I am...uhhh...
  musketeer+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: A smiling snake struggles to hide its fangs.
  musketeer+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: How can I be sure that is medicine?
  musketeer+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Oh suddenly you practice physic?
  musketeer+str_block_item_depressed_0: Death is certain, so this is without merit.
  musketeer+str_block_item_depressed_1: Save it for someone with hope.
  musketeer+str_block_item_irrational_0: What would I do with such a lizard?
  musketeer+str_block_item_irrational_1: A lovely child, is it yours?
  musketeer+str_block_item_masochistic_0: I requested salt for my gashes, thank you.
  musketeer+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Will it enhance the pain?
  musketeer+str_block_item_paranoid_0: Another tactic in your conspiracy, eh?
  musketeer+str_block_item_paranoid_1: A traitor's weakness lies in a false sense
    of superiority.
  musketeer+str_block_move_abusive_0: I will not suffer a fool's pretense.
  musketeer+str_block_move_abusive_1: Why should I even consider your counsel on this
    matter?
  musketeer+str_block_move_fearful_0: Leave me here to die!
  musketeer+str_block_move_fearful_1: My very will is snuffed out!
  musketeer+str_block_move_irrational_0: Remove the irons from my legs first.
  musketeer+str_block_move_irrational_1: To where? Time and space are phantasm.
  musketeer+str_block_move_masochistic_0: To move would distract me from the pain...
  musketeer+str_block_move_masochistic_1: I am fine to bleed here.
  musketeer+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Keep me from the traitor!
  musketeer+str_block_move_paranoid_1: It could be any of you, leave off!
  musketeer+str_buff_party_powerful_0: I will show you how we can finish this!
  musketeer+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Which of us will earn its skull?!
  musketeer+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: See now? You have the heart of
    a hunter.
  musketeer+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Watch your target grow larger
    and larger, in your mind's eye!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: A coward's will drives these traitorous
    limbs.
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: I beg you for protection with nothing
    to barter.
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Perhaps the morrow's dawn will rekindle
    my spirit.
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: Get it away from me! Away!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: I won't die here!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: We should flee!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_irrational_0: Two hups and a tweet for you, m'lord!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_irrational_1: Quick hide! We want to surprise him
    for his naming day!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_irrational_2: Algebra? The ancient Arabic numerological
    treatise?!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: I feel as if my back is a straw target!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: Your presence behind me is vexing!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: Further away from you, betrayer!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: Consider it a lesson in self-sufficiency!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: I did not sign on to clean up the slop
    of your blunders!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: Better I live and save us all than be wasted
    up front!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: The weak should be culled from the herd.
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: I offer myself, a hollow braggart, to
    a fitting end.
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: I have been tried by the hunt and found
    wanting.
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: And now for my next act...
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: It cackles wildly with the voices from
    my mind!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Some fruit appears lush yet rot marbles
    through it!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: Let those arrows and blows land sweet
    upon my brow!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: I left my armour leagues back!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Is this not tempting enough, fiends?
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: No lion permits the jackals first pick of
    the kill!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Behind me, covetous vultures!
  musketeer+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: You're welcome!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: You threaten the hunt with your
    selfish attacks!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: You have enraged it! Let me finish
    it next time!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Nicely done, now there are two!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Secretly, I despise mummers
    as well!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: I would have slain it!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: A clumsy blow to ruin the trophy!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Your wild swings are a threat
    to your own party!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: Did something shiny catch your
    eye? Pfah!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: There is no slaying it! We must
    fly!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: The hunt is off, we are now
    the prey!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: You remind me of my wetnurse
    in this light.
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: A musket is merely a tulip
    that is simply a trout.
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: How did they tempt you into
    betrayal?
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: What does it take to tempt
    one to fight alongside fiends?
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Your miss throws my tactics
    into chaos!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: I only have enough powder to
    save myself!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: And that is what separates you attendants
    from us hunters.
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: More proof you will never lead your own
    expedition.
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Hold! Hold for the sake of us all!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: The grave's black maw will swallow us
    all!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: It whispers, the earth itself...
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: I admit, I have no idea which tree
    to tap for ale.
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: I do wish such blows could be shared...
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: I would give anything to be in your
    place right now!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: How clever! A traitor's ruse!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Even fiends cannot bear to let a traitor
    live!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: The terror consumes me!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: See how vulnerable we are!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Of course, it was the ants!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Of course one cannot simply slay
    a ghost!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: We are being deceived, coward!
  musketeer+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: They are in league, the proof is everywhere!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: How much blood do I have left to bleed?!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: This prey may be beyond my ability...
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: This tribe communicates in a most peculiar
    manner!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: What a waste of good suffering!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Yes...yes...
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: The sensation is indescribable...
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: I sense foul conspiracy driving these
    blows!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: Ah! One of you shoved me!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Pray I survive! Our fate hangs on it!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Why was I not warned?!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Will it be over soon?!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: They will not cease until we lie in
    pieces!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: That scent, so familiar...
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: Why does the moon weep blood?
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Oh come now, am I that hard to
    hit?
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: Do you not recognize opportunity
    for mutual benefit?
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: How did that slip through?!
  musketeer+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: One of us stirs their wrath!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_0: This prize is mine!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_1: All too easy!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_2: What a shot!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_3: Another one for the bag!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_4: A fine blast!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_5: See how it staggers!
  musketeer+str_critbyhero_6: There's more where that came from!
  musketeer+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Mountain-folk breathe like this to lift the
    spirits!
  musketeer+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: I am honoured to have you as pack mates!
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: My heart is an ash-filled pit, all embers
    long dead.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: A corpse pit awaits us as this trail unwinds
    itself.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: I am caught in the web and the spider
    comes lazily.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Be silent! BE SILENT!
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: This trail lies deep in the shadow of ill-fortune.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: Something awaits, and it is not of man.
    We will all die.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: They said the jungle came alive and took
    him...
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: Fill the kitty's saucer with more cream!
    Now!
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: Do not spill, it will kill the grass.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: All I can trust now are my hunter's instincts!
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: Hunted by my own party, ironic.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: The purity of the hunt is soiled by your
    conspiracies!
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: Leave be, I aim to survive this, with or
    without you.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: I will not blunder foolish into their blows.
  musketeer+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: Do not presume to press your faulty counsel.
  musketeer+str_mark_self_depressed_0: The grave is dug and its black maw beckons.
  musketeer+str_mark_self_depressed_1: I am no hunter, then I can only be prey.
  musketeer+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Perchance now he will notice me!
  musketeer+str_mark_self_irrational_1: Hit me and I will burst open spilling coins
    for all!
  musketeer+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Blood always draws the most dangerous of
    fiends.
  musketeer+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Come fiends! Pleasure me with pain!
  musketeer+str_mark_self_masochistic_2: My flesh aches for gashes and wounds!
  musketeer+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: Why did I feel I had to prove myself
    to the club?!
  musketeer+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: It is a mirror showing me my infinite
    flaws!
  musketeer+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: There is no courage inside me! None!
  musketeer+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: All for one, and one for
    all!
  musketeer+str_random_command_abusive_0: Do your best to follow, curs!
  musketeer+str_random_command_abusive_1: Do as I do or die on the trail!
  musketeer+str_random_command_abusive_2: The rabble's opinions are the bleatings
    of simple sheep.
  musketeer+str_random_command_depressed_0: What foul trail have we followed?
  musketeer+str_random_command_depressed_1: My choices all tainted by the hand of
    doom.
  musketeer+str_random_command_depressed_2: Fate itself hunts me, where can I hide?
  musketeer+str_random_command_irrational_0: Cartwheel east and unleash the beasts!
    Cartwheel west...
  musketeer+str_random_command_irrational_1: My dreams are filled with moonlit flights!
  musketeer+str_random_command_irrational_2: Ah to bathe in a cauldron with the other
    rabbits...
  musketeer+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Fortune's blows rain down on those it
    cannot command!
  musketeer+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Find me swinging swords! Rending claws!
    Blighting hexes!
  musketeer+str_random_command_masochistic_2: Will this tempt their blows?
  musketeer+str_random_command_paranoid_0: Does it disturb you that your prey remains
    unpredictable?
  musketeer+str_random_command_paranoid_1: I cannot hide, but I can slip through your
    grasp!
  musketeer+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Paranoia will keep me from your greasy
    daggers!
  musketeer+str_random_command_selfish_0: To catch the beast one must think like one!
  musketeer+str_random_command_selfish_1: Hinder me and the expedition falls!
  musketeer+str_random_command_selfish_2: I had something more clever in mind!
  musketeer+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: We have their scent, they will fall!
  musketeer+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Take these berries, an old bush trick.
  musketeer+str_stress_heal_stalwart_0: Blessings be! Hope returns!
  musketeer+str_stress_heal_stalwart_1: Victory is near! My soul burns!
  musketeer+str_virtued_courageous_0: We are the first to ever stalk this prey!
  musketeer+str_virtued_courageous_1: Take heart! The quarry knows it is caught!
  musketeer+str_virtued_focused_0: Nothing can stop us from our prize now!
  musketeer+str_virtued_focused_1: The thrill of the hunt clears my mind!
  musketeer+str_virtued_powerful_0: The hunter rules from the apex!
  musketeer+str_virtued_powerful_1: Man is the ultimate predator!
  musketeer+str_virtued_stalwart_0: If we persist the quarry is ours!
  musketeer+str_virtued_stalwart_1: We will not turn back now!
  musketeer+str_virtued_stalwart_2: So long as my musket still roars..!
  musketeer+str_virtued_stalwart_3: Shrug off your wounds and join me in the chase!
  musketeer+str_virtued_stalwart_4: This prize was meant to be claimed!
  musketeer+str_virtued_vigorous_0: I will not be stopped until the hunt is won!
  musketeer+str_virtued_vigorous_1: I am like a wolf, following tirelessly, waiting
    for weakness!
occultist:
  occultist+str_afflicted_abusive_0: COWER, FOOLS. CHMOR BROGH PHTREEA LROM. HA HASSA.
  occultist+str_afflicted_abusive_1: They cannot begin to guess Its power.
  occultist+str_afflicted_abusive_2: You boorish brigands are an insult to the human
    intellect.
  occultist+str_afflicted_abusive_3: There exists techniques to treat all flavors
    of idiocy...
  occultist+str_afflicted_abusive_4: RLMARG AROMPHA TRAMAL. YOUR DEATHS ARE IRRELEVANT.
  occultist+str_afflicted_depressed_0: Leave me alone! Leave me to my commandeered
    mind!
  occultist+str_afflicted_depressed_1: I will never escape It. I will suffocate first.
  occultist+str_afflicted_depressed_2: I toyed with greatness -- now I suffer eternally.
  occultist+str_afflicted_depressed_3: They must never know what I am becoming...
    Never.
  occultist+str_afflicted_depressed_4: The beast is unhinging my mind. Dark fantasies
    emerge...
  occultist+str_afflicted_fearful_0: My mind flies in an empty abyss! So horrible!
  occultist+str_afflicted_fearful_1: I see the blackened vault!  Vast, limitless,
    terrible!
  occultist+str_afflicted_fearful_2: I feel terror grasping at my soul!
  occultist+str_afflicted_fearful_3: Fear is a mental construct... I must deny it!
  occultist+str_afflicted_fearful_4: My control is fading! It is coming through!
  occultist+str_afflicted_irrational_0: There are suckers growing on my elbows!
  occultist+str_afflicted_irrational_1: MNAH GL'AK OBOOSHUU FTAGUH. HOM NGLUI.
  occultist+str_afflicted_irrational_2: KADISHTU FORMAZ GLER'AKTII. FOMALHAUT BEG'INN.
  occultist+str_afflicted_irrational_3: MEN'ALISH GRAK NI'KTOO SIRIUS. HOORVAN GRAK
    SNOOAVC!
  occultist+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Warm is the dawn, yet so distant the horizon...
  occultist+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: DESTROY THIS BODY. IT IS MY CAGE.
  occultist+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: STRIP AWAY THE MORTAL FLESH. SEE MY GLORY.
  occultist+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: AM'YOGHN KTAH MYEP NGORHEM. NYARLATHOTEP
    FOGRAAHG.
  occultist+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: WOUND THIS PATHETIC CREATURE. IT BEGS FOR
    DEATH.
  occultist+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: I WILL GORGE MYSELF ON THIS BODY'S BLOOD.
    KRT'RAGHN MYA.
  occultist+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: I must stay ever-vigilant, lest It take me...
  occultist+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: Is it the wind that howls so unmercifully...?
  occultist+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: It is here. It lurks at the periphery of my
    mind...
  occultist+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: We must hurry! Fetid aberrations nip at our
    heels!
  occultist+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: The others fear my power... I must remain wary
    of them.
  occultist+str_afflicted_selfish_0: Yes, I am on sabbatical. E'en so, I do not work
    for free.
  occultist+str_afflicted_selfish_1: If they filch one penny from me, I'll burn them
    alive.
  occultist+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Little lucre always comes in handy, tenured though
    I am...
  occultist+str_afflicted_selfish_3: Let me study the artifacts. Few others are qualified.
  occultist+str_afflicted_selfish_4: This is not my fair share. I know - I have studied
    maths.
  occultist+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: Ignorant whelp! I will show you power!
  occultist+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: I have more power than your pitiful mind
    can conceive!
  occultist+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: CHAOS AND RUIN. (deafening laughter)
  occultist+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: THERE IS NO LIGHT. NO BLACK. ONLY PANDEMONIUM.
  occultist+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: THE STAR-GODS KNOW YOUR MIND, PUNY MORTAL.
  occultist+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: THEY DESIRE MY POWER. YOU WILL SHOW IT
    TO THEM.
  occultist+str_attack_self_depressed_0: What do I care? Unleash this black-beast
    on the world!
  occultist+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Free me from this terrible matrimony!
  occultist+str_attack_self_irrational_0: I SHALL BREAK HIM AS C'THOGUS WILL BREAK
    THIS WORLD.
  occultist+str_attack_self_irrational_1: I WILL SMASH THIS PATHETIC CELL AND RETURN
    TO THE STARS.
  occultist+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: Yes... soon It shall reveal itself.
  occultist+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Witness my will! See that I cannot be dissuaded!
  occultist+str_bark_deathsdoor: This was not the deal we struck!
  occultist+str_bark_encourage_0: Song is proven to raise moral. So... a one and a
    two and a...
  occultist+str_bark_encourage_1: Two plus two is four. See? Things are not so uncertain.
  occultist+str_bark_encourage_2: Fear is a mental state; change your mind and you
    conquer it.
  occultist+str_bark_first_aid_0: Anatomy is hardly my specialty, I'll admit.
  occultist+str_bark_first_aid_1: I am now glad I attended a liberal arts university.
  occultist+str_bark_first_aid_2: Best complete this procedure. The blood... it riles
    me.
  occultist+str_bark_hobby_0: Why, I am documenting the journey, of course. Care to
    read?
  occultist+str_bark_hobby_1: Some quiet, please. I am on the verge of breaking the
    cypher.
  occultist+str_bark_hobby_2: Sigh... it is too dark to study my rituals here.
  occultist+str_bark_pep_talk_0: We must work together, as the tribal-folk do.
  occultist+str_bark_pep_talk_1: You must distract your mind. Think of happier times.
  occultist+str_bark_pep_talk_2: I know a rite for this. It will calm you.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: FOOLISH FLESHY INSECTS. FGH'HORAK JOMORALSH.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: CH'THON SHEBBOTH. I WILL BREAK YOU.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: YOUR PATHETIC UNIVERSE IS WHEAT TO THE SCYTHE.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Silence! Can't you see I'm studying my
    scrolls!?
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: I am reminded of the value of public education...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Quiet, now. Or I'll hex you to sleep.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: Cannot sleep... the black-beast is ever-roaring...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: I would trade all my power for a glass
    of fresh water...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: Will I ever possess my own mind again?
    Or am I lost?
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_3: Some think the Flame is holy. I know
    otherwise...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: We dare not linger... the air is foul
    here.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Put out the light! We attract danger!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: Shh!.. You announce our location with
    your idle talk!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: No.. (grunts)... I will not! They deserve
    a chance!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: No... no, you can't make me... I will
    not...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Summers at the beach... love in the
    forest... in the glens...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Must not sleep... must not surrender
    to dreams...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: If I sleep now, It will see me. Must
    resist... must...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: This food tastes of ash... but I must
    eat...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: The others must surely know my secret
    by now...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Must not let the others guess my true
    nature...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: My ritual scrolls are out of order. Who
    could have...?
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: Any artifacts we find should go to the
    university...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Give me all your candles. I require them
    for my rituals.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: I am out of moustache wax. Let's make
    this quick.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: I feel It boiling up within... It is coming
    through!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: The black-beast presses against the veil...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: No! If my strength wanes, all will come to
    despair...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: We cannot win! It is simple math!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: These creatures are a death-sending! Formed
    of murder!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: No... My will falters! I feel It tearing through!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: If you wish to meet It, then by all means...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: Yes... cut me down. You only seal your
    demise.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: HRRRRRAAAGH, YES. SAVAGE THIS BODY. SET
    ME FREE.
  occultist+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: This is not real... it is an illusion of the
    mind!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: They have brought me here on purpose... A
    trap...
  occultist+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: They seek to kill me and set It free! NO!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Do not touch their bodies! I must inspect them
    first!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Only fire can purify this taint! Stand aside!
  occultist+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: Do not damage the head! I need it for my rituals!
  occultist+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Just let me go... You'll be doing the cosmos
    a favor.
  occultist+str_block_buff_depressed_1: I am a dying star. Let me burn out quietly.
  occultist+str_block_buff_depressed_2: There is no fighting it. We shall not survive.
  occultist+str_block_buff_irrational_0: You wish to feel my fire? I can oblige if
    you wish...
  occultist+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Stay back! The black-beast... It has seen
    you!
  occultist+str_block_buff_irrational_2: It does not want your mercy. It wants only
    death!
  occultist+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: SOW YOUR EVIL ON THIS MAN. HE LONGS FOR
    RELEASE.
  occultist+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: HA HA HA HAAAAAAA. G'ROMALKIN DUH'ROTARK
    GLON.
  occultist+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: NO... It feeds on my blood... Must starve
    It out...
  occultist+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Your silly tricks are powerless against me!
  occultist+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: You think I am blind? I can see through your
    soul!
  occultist+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: Your deceit is laid bare. Do not try that again.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I would, but... I have a stomach bug.
    Of a sort.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: I would prefer to read. Thank you.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: KEEP YOUR FOUL PROVISIONS. THEY STINK
    OF WEAKNESS.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: BRING ME HUMAN FLESH, OR NOUGHT ELSE.
    GO.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: A light belly has always served
    me well.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: No thank you. Just a little coffee
    and biscuit.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: I trust you utterly, but I swear I
    saw a beetle.
  occultist+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: "(gags)... No, it's lovely, I'm just...
    full. Now."
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Fear clouds your undeveloped
    minds.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Disturb me again and I will
    burn you to the bone.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: You have not seen mortal
    danger. You embarrass me.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: The black-beast speaks
    of doom... and I believe it.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: We fall into blackness.
    Nothing can save us.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: Oblivion is inevitable.
    Accept it.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: There are voices... You also
    hear them, yes?
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: I cannot. My mind is occupied
    with preventing flight.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: You see that?! That is no
    natural mist!
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: THESE LIVES ARE NOT WORTH
    OUR TIME. IGNORE THEM.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: NO. YOU SHALL KNOW DESPAIR
    BEFORE MY COMING.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: FOOLISH MORTALS. YOU RAGE
    AND STRUGGLE FOR NOTHING.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: "... Honestly, I'm not
    sure I wish to survive..."
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: No. Peril is the very
    font of bravery. I read that.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: You seek contentedness...
    but that is an illusion.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: "... You seek to distract
    me. Go on, deny it!"
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: What is your game? Rob me
    while I look away?
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: Ha! I am trained in mind-reading,
    you know...
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: You want me to spend my powers...
    for free?
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: You know, I have an enormous
    student loan debt...
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: If I give an inch, these
    louts will take a mile...
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: ENOUGH OF YOUR SIMPLE TRICKS.
    SUBMIT TO MY POWER.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: BRAINLESS HUMAN SPAWNLINGS.
    YOUR POWER IS AS NOTHING.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: There is no point. We cannot
    outplay perdition.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: An inevitable doom is coming
    for us. Make your peace.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: I prefer the pain. It drowns
    out the voice...
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: There can be no victory
    without challenge.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: Stop. Stop... Let me think
    this through.
  occultist+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: That is unnecessary. And potentially
    unsanitary.
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: I crave the most final experience.
    One you cannot read about.
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: 'Think positively: we shall know
    what no man alive can know.'
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: NOOO! ... (weird grunting)... NO,
    YOU STAY IN THERE!
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: STOP! We... (labored breathing)...
    We must flee! PLEASE!
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Ha. Perhaps it is time I and It
    went our separate ways...
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: Hmm. I find I rather like a little...
    humiliation. (grin)
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: Nonsense. Entertain your deceptions
    elsewhere.
  occultist+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: I think not. If you doubted us, you
    should not have paid us.
  occultist+str_block_heal_depressed_0: It's no use. My wound cannot be cured...
  occultist+str_block_heal_depressed_1: You cannot cure my wound. No mortal can...
  occultist+str_block_heal_depressed_2: No. I traded fair and square for this...
  occultist+str_block_heal_irrational_0: SAVE YOUR IMPOTENT EFFORTS. THIS ONE IS MINE.
  occultist+str_block_heal_irrational_1: YOU WILL NOT SAVE HIM. HE IS MINE BY RIGHT.
  occultist+str_block_heal_irrational_2: IT IS TOO LATE, MORTAL. HIS SOUL BELONGS
    TO ME.
  occultist+str_block_heal_irrational_3: DO NOT TOUCH HIM. WE HAVE A CONTRACT.
  occultist+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Stay back. I know you seek to steal my power.
  occultist+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: I'll not have you rifling my things!
  occultist+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Cease! Your intentions are painfully obvious!
  occultist+str_block_item_depressed_0: If the mind cannot survive this, then I am
    surely dead.
  occultist+str_block_item_depressed_1: I choose mind over matter. This at least remains
    true.
  occultist+str_block_item_irrational_0: KEEP YOUR TRINKETS. I NEED NOTHING BUT THIS
    MAN'S HEART!
  occultist+str_block_item_irrational_1: FOOLISH MORTAL INSTRUMENTS. THEY CANNOT TOUCH
    THE SOUL.
  occultist+str_block_item_masochistic_0: No thank you. I rather like a little self-torture.
  occultist+str_block_item_masochistic_1: STAY BACK, OR I WILL CRUSH YOU. THIS FOOL
    MUST DIE.
  occultist+str_block_item_paranoid_0: Enough of your flea market snake oil!
  occultist+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Please, I am too old to be tricked so.
  occultist+str_block_move_abusive_0: A stagnant mind is indeed the result of adversity
    avoided...
  occultist+str_block_move_abusive_1: I understand -- you are afraid. Ergo, I hold
    my ground.
  occultist+str_block_move_fearful_0: THIS ONE WILL STAY HERE AND WATCH YOU ALL DIE.
  occultist+str_block_move_fearful_1: No. Death shall be my greatest expedition.
  occultist+str_block_move_irrational_0: STAY BACK. YOG'HRANITH NELCHARIQ.
  occultist+str_block_move_irrational_1: YOU STRUGGLE AND FIGHT, AND THE OLD ONES
    WEAVE YOUR FATE.
  occultist+str_block_move_masochistic_0: No. I am placed perfectly. Right near the
    action.
  occultist+str_block_move_masochistic_1: Learning is itself risky. So hold fast,
    and pay attention.
  occultist+str_block_move_paranoid_0: You may trick the others, but not I. Hold firm.
  occultist+str_block_move_paranoid_1: Please, I am too old for these palace intrigues...
  occultist+str_buff_party_powerful_0: The black-beast does not share his power freely...
  occultist+str_buff_party_powerful_1: GO FORTH, KINDLING, AND BURN IN STARFIRE.
  occultist+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: YES, MORTAL CH'TROG. USE MY POWER.
    (evil laughter)
  occultist+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: Beware... The black-beast's power
    carries hidden costs.
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I see my hubris now... The supernatural
    IS superior.
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: With every incantation, the black-beast
    only strengthens...
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: All my study is meaningless in this arena!
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: I must retreat... before the fear breaches
    my control!
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: Calm, professor... Calm!
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Society must surely fall to such blind
    conviction!
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: No! My power is mine alone! Only I can
    bear it!
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: I know what they want... It is mine, you
    hear me!
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: My dark traveler calls to them. They seek
    its favor.
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: You younger folk should take the lead...
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: So tired... these arcane energies do take
    their toll.
  occultist+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: I have done my part. Now it is your turn.
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: Even if I succeed, I shall never be rid
    of... It.
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Like all before us, our civilization must
    fall...
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: My will fades... the black-beast shall
    go free...
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: FOOLISH MORTAL. ATTACK AND YOU MAY YET
    LIVE.
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: Ungh... my head, pounding.... pounding
    from the inside!
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: So much rage... It fights to tear through!
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: The greatest strides demand great sacrifice.
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: Acquisition of first-hand knowledge
    always carries a cost...
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: This one could have artifacts of interest
    to my study!
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: I must observe their behaviour more closely...
  occultist+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: Fascinating! Let me through a little. Lovely.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: YOU THINK YOURSELF POWERFUL. BUT
    YOU ARE AN INSECT.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: MORTALS FIGHTING MORTALS. WHAT
    DULL AMUSEMENT.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: PATHETIC. YOU ARE LITTLE MORE
    THAN DUST.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: GLORY IS A MORTAL ILLUSION.
    A VEIL FOR THE INSIGNIFICANT.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: See? It's easy when you have a
    teacher like myself.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Good. The younger folk should indeed
    do most of the work.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: I can hear It laughing at you...
    inside my mind.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: You are improving. Albeit slowly.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: We'll be picked off one by one!
    It is simple numbers!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Knowledge of the afterlife will
    soon be mine...
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: AS'KARAKH NOMARAGH. BOMORAL'CH
    TO-YUMILAF. IA IA IA.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: BURN, INSECT. BURN IN THE
    FIRE OF TIME.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: No one - not even a child -
    could have missed that...
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: That was not logical. What
    are you hiding?!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Fascinating. I could write a
    paper on misfortune about you.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: Hold still... I want to fix
    your failure in my mind.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: That wasn't particularly wise, now was
    it?
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: You should dodge next time. That's just
    a little tip.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: No!... I feel It coming through!...
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Keep away from me!... (grunt)... I cannot
    control It!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: The stars wheel above us... They foretell
    of doom!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: Nothing but blackness for you... for
    us all.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: I would sacrifice myself similarly,
    given the chance...
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: No! Focus your hatred on me! ME!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: I have seen that one... in my dreams!
    My nightmares!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: They are driven by demonic power. Mark
    my words...
  occultist+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: You are toying with forces beyond your
    ken!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: This path takes us to oblivion! Let
    us change our fate!
  occultist+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: SIGGRATH'THAN HORROBAHD. MIK.
  occultist+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: FIGHT AND DIE, GOD-PAWNS. OBLIVION
    AWAITS.
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: No! (grunting) NO! It must not be set
    free!
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: Protect me! (groaning) It is coming through!
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: COME AGAIN, FOOL. I WILL TEACH YOU
    SUFFERING.
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: YOU TEST ME, MORTAL. FIGHT, OR I SHALL
    ABANDON YOU.
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: You cannot dissuade me. Not even your
    cruel weapons can.
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: If you kill me, the black-beast will
    devour you. (grins)
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: They've been spying on us... They KNOW
    us.
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: Blast! ... What villain has cast them
    upon us?
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Rather rough treatment for an honored
    scholar, no?
  occultist+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: "(pained grunt) I am too old for this."
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: Stars above! What foolishness brought
    me here!
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: Protect me! HEEELP!
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: KORTCH-AN R'KHORTH, YOU PATHETIC
    WEAKLING.
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: RAHM'NORVATH M'CROHAN TOOLEN'BAHT.
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: And so I am forced to go on, I
    with my dark hitchhiker.
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: You are fair pitiless, to spare
    a tainted old sorcerer.
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: This cretin... Has it out for me,
    I think.
  occultist+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: I should not have worn red. I stand
    out like a lantern.
  occultist+str_critbyhero_0: Another fool for the fire!
  occultist+str_critbyhero_1: Uneducated savage!
  occultist+str_critbyhero_2: So uncivilized!
  occultist+str_critbyhero_3: FM'LATGH, GRAH'N.
  occultist+str_critbyhero_4: MNAHN'T GOF'NN.
  occultist+str_critbyhero_5: Y'LW'NAFH N'GHFT.
  occultist+str_critbyhero_6: Behold! The unquenchable fire of the stars!
  occultist+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: DIE ANOTHER DAY, MORTAL. I HAVE NEED OF YOU.
  occultist+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: SARTHOR'GOR AN PHIROAH. MARASTH LIKA'LAH BOH'NROTH.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: The fire will not answer... The stars
    denounce us.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: My rituals are weakening. Without them,
    I am nothing...
  occultist+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: Too late for that. It comes for us all.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: My willpower has faltered... the mind, compromised...
  occultist+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: I cannot concentrate -- so unsettled I am.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: I have stared overlong into the fuliginous
    abyss.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: I... cannot... ungh... the black-beast
    has seized me!
  occultist+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: The orbs are not beings... They are balls
    of fire...
  occultist+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: "...countless worlds boiling in a Stygian
    broth..."
  occultist+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: My mind gives way - I cannot!
  occultist+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I am wiser than that.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: Ha! A textbook diversion. I am not tricked
    so easily.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: I decline. The mind requires rest.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: I cannot wield the dark arts endlessly.
    I must rest.
  occultist+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: I must preserve my focus!
  occultist+str_mark_self_depressed_0: I cannot let It escape... DESTROY ME! NOW!
  occultist+str_mark_self_depressed_1: YES. FREE ME FROM THIS MORTAL PRISON. FREE
    ME.
  occultist+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Approach and die! I will vomit this demon
    upon you!
  occultist+str_mark_self_irrational_1: You want to see power? Kill me then, and despair.
  occultist+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Demon! Reveal your darkest works, that I
    may learn!
  occultist+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: FOE OR FOOL -- ALL ARE MY PUPPETS.
  occultist+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: What is this vision? Torn apart from
    the inside??!
  occultist+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: These black arts... Fascinating and
    terrifying...
  occultist+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: It conjures a fell energy!
  occultist+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Finally, the face of my tormentor.
    Come, then.
  occultist+str_random_command_abusive_0: Interesting idea, though clearly an uninformed
    one.
  occultist+str_random_command_abusive_1: Tsk, tsk, tsk... You should look to your
    schooling.
  occultist+str_random_command_abusive_2: I daresay your experience in these matters
    is lacking.
  occultist+str_random_command_depressed_0: Please, we have far exceeded all logical
    thought.
  occultist+str_random_command_depressed_1: Surrender yourself to the will of the
    black-beast...
  occultist+str_random_command_depressed_2: Salvation is a construct of the fatigued
    mind...
  occultist+str_random_command_irrational_0: MAKE YOUR PEACE, MORTALS. I BURN THROUGH.
  occultist+str_random_command_irrational_1: I AM THE BLACK-BEAST. PERISH IN FLAME.
  occultist+str_random_command_irrational_2: HG'ROKAN MANOGASN EL'CTHORGHRAKORH L'LOARX-R'GHAN.
  occultist+str_random_command_masochistic_0: MAKE YOUR FEAST UPON THIS PITIFUL MAN.
    HA-HAAAAA.
  occultist+str_random_command_masochistic_1: GRRAAAAAA! SAVAGE THIS CREATURE. SPILL
    HIS BRAINS.
  occultist+str_random_command_masochistic_2: FREE ME FROM THIS MORTAL PRISON, YOU
    M'RORGH R'KHNAS!
  occultist+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I... I cannot tell what is real, what illusion!
  occultist+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Motes of black dance before me! What is
    happening?!
  occultist+str_random_command_paranoid_2: YOU CANNOT EVEN CONTROL YOUR OWN THOUGHTS,
    WEAKLING.
  occultist+str_random_command_selfish_0: The black-beast commands else... and I cannot
    argue.
  occultist+str_random_command_selfish_1: My wondering mind commands a different tactic.
    Sorry.
  occultist+str_random_command_selfish_2: Let us try something else. As a learning
    experience!
  occultist+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: My power has healed them, true...
    but at what cost?
  occultist+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: The black-beast is merciful this day...
  occultist+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: Fell energy courses through me...
  occultist+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: Such dark power... Would that it were
    truly mine.
  occultist+str_virtued_courageous_0: No evil can stand against the united human intellect!
  occultist+str_virtued_courageous_1: We have survived thus far! We can survive so
    much more!
  occultist+str_virtued_focused_0: One quieted mind can defeat all the world's ills.
  occultist+str_virtued_focused_1: Ah... the serenity of total mental concentration.
  occultist+str_virtued_powerful_0: The moon waxes... blood-dark and roaring.
  occultist+str_virtued_powerful_1: Physique, soul, and intellect, in perfect harmony.
  occultist+str_virtued_powerful_2: The stars have aligned.
  occultist+str_virtued_stalwart_0: Foolishness, this fear! I deny it utterly!
  occultist+str_virtued_stalwart_1: The civilized mind can o'erperch any abyss!
  occultist+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Psychosomatics, wielded artfully, are akin to
    magic.
  occultist+str_virtued_vigorous_1: Mind over matter!
plague_doctor:
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_abusive_0: You are all mewling babes. I will show you
    strength!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_abusive_1: Silence! Or I'll expose you all to corrosive
    humours!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Your wake bears the linger of rotting flesh...
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_abusive_3: You halfwits are interrupting my concentration!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_abusive_4: Uneducated brutes! The ignorance! The idiocy!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_depressed_0: Sorrow and toil...sorrow and toil.
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_depressed_1: Those fools will never respect my work...
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_depressed_2: So cold inside. Like a morgue.
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_depressed_3: I have nothing... I offer little more than
    a corpse.
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_depressed_4: These tests are fruitless! I verge on failure!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_fearful_0: I am no stranger to death, but how can one
    bear these horrors!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_fearful_1: I have seen much pain. And yet the thought
    chills me.
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_fearful_2: Blood in my eyes... blood in my throat..
    blood...
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_fearful_3: "... pulse quickens... humours churn... body
    reacts..."
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_fearful_4: So this is the death-bed fear, is it?
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_irrational_0: Burst those boils! Leech those wounds!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_irrational_1: Where did that scalpel go... Eh, I will
    find it later.
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_irrational_2: There are shapes cavorting in the mist.
    Look there!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_irrational_3: My feet smell of gangrene! YOU - smell
    these!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Eureka! Bubonic plague and lavender TOGETHER!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: I can survive endless blight! Cast it
    upon me!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: Injury is the source of infection...
    sweet infection.
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: Finally... the doctor becomes the patient!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: Ah... my wounds fester... I must have
    MORE!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Cut me again, villain. My humours seed
    the night air!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: I see how you all conspire to end me!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: This has all been a decoy to steal my formulas!
    Deny it!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: You will not have my secrets! NO YOU SHALL
    NOT!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: I hear the miasma... it whispers of suffering!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: Stop breathing on me! I'll catch cold!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_selfish_0: If anyone gets out alive, it will be me!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Perhaps the party would make a donation to
    my research?
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Surely you find my experiments to be of great
    value...
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_selfish_3: My fees just increased. Don't question me
    -- I am a doctor!
  plague_doctor+str_afflicted_selfish_4: Save the physic first! Else who will maintain
    your vigor?
  plague_doctor+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: You are fouling my aim! Brute! Idiot!
  plague_doctor+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: You have more value as a cadaver for
    my experiments.
  plague_doctor+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: The age of plague begins!
  plague_doctor+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: Fester and die, dear creature!
  plague_doctor+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: You want my secrets! You would take
    them off my corpse!
  plague_doctor+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: You fear my knowledge. You cannot
    understand it!
  plague_doctor+str_attack_self_depressed_0: There is only one proper, true way to
    test death...
  plague_doctor+str_attack_self_depressed_1: And I shall be judged by all those who
    died under my knife...
  plague_doctor+str_attack_self_irrational_0: I prescribe death.
  plague_doctor+str_attack_self_irrational_1: Heather and lilac and juniper and lavender...
  plague_doctor+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: When one is a healer, one is nearly
    immortal!
  plague_doctor+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: A scratch worries me not! Life and
    death are my playthings!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_deathsdoor: All flesh fails, in the fullness of time.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_encourage_0: Here... quaff this tonic. It restores the humors.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_encourage_1: Apply this unguent. It strengthens the will.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_encourage_2: Smoke this leaf. It will restore your confidence.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_first_aid_0: Let me drain the fluids. They could be useful.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_first_aid_1: Change that dressing twice daily and you may
    yet live.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_first_aid_2: An impressive wound! Let me make a quick sketch.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_hobby_0: Some bark of aspen? Or maybe boiled cerato leaf?
    Hmm...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_hobby_1: Hold that wound still. My sketch is nearly done.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_hobby_2: May I lance that boil? The pus is intriguingly gray!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_pep_talk_0: We can cure this place's ills. We are its medicine.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_pep_talk_1: Like a vaccine, we shall inoculate this land
    against evil!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_pep_talk_2: Fear wears off in time. Much like a mild poison.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: Your wounds aid my studies immensely!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Hmmm... deformed at birth or merely hideous?
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Gah! Your rank odors suggest a fungating
    wound!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: Cross me and you'll wake up sick.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: I marvel at some people's ignorance.
    For shame.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Conversation? No. ... Vivisection?
    Very possibly...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: Why press on?  Let us wait here
    for sickness and death.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: I have spilled my latest batch of
    plague. We're doomed.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: Nonsense! There is no Light and
    no God! Just death!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: I don't want to die down here...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: Death lingers at the door...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: If I die, leave my body here to feed
    the maggots.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: The plague is not death, it is
    life.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: Have you ever smelled a cadaver?
    (sigh) Exquisite.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: If I could find my scalpel, I'd
    improve your face.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Hah!  I don't even want the wounds
    to heal.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: Must save these scabs for later....
    ouch! .... ow!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_2: "... and two drops of blood...
    Aye, that smarts!"
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: You're sick - all of you, sick!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Injuries can be treated. Emotional
    trauma however...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: How many times must I remind you
    to WASH YOUR HANDS?
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: I bear the brunt of our troubles,
    and should be rewarded accordingly.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: That's a nasty cough. Let me collect
    the spittle.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Urinate in this flask. No, you're
    fine -- I just need it.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: It seems that true evil can indeed defy
    the intellect.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: All my training, yet still I am incompetent...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: The bell tolls for us!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: The body stands, but the mind buckles.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: My research fails us here. We must away!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_irrational_0: One heart, two lungs, two hands!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: Is plague evil? Or evil plague? Evil?
    PLAGUE??
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: 1, 2, 3, 4, the human heart shall beat
    no more...
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: These scars and wounds merely temper
    my flesh!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Do thy worst! You will not find me
    lacking!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: The very air carries death upon it!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Even if we survive, more will follow!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: Death has caught our scent. There is no
    escape.
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: I won't end up a plaything for amateur
    physicians!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Don't touch the bodies until I've inspected
    them!
  plague_doctor+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: I claim their bodies... for science!
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_depressed_0: Your efforts are a bandage applied to
    a tumor.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_depressed_1: No technique exists that can defy death.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_depressed_2: No. If I die, it is the way of elan vital.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_irrational_0: You, assist me?  Ridiculous!
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_irrational_1: Approach any closer and I'll trepan you.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_irrational_2: No. I am testing my pain threshold this
    day.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: You're no more qualified than I.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: The body and mind can o'ercome all.
    Watch.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: I put my trust exclusively in the corporeal.
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: I have studied medicine enough...I see
    you are but a knife in the back!
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: Does that have any proven medicinal effect?
  plague_doctor+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: There is no science in that! Shamanism,
    perhaps!
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: I cannot eat while my research
    suffers...
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Seems both my appetite and confidence
    have atrophied...
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Nine, ten, eleven, twelve! Crack
    the ribs, then dig and delve!
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: Death floats on the wind... nests
    in my hand.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: I would rather expire slowly
    than eat this.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: No. Fasting sharpens the instincts.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: What, pray tell, is in this...
    "food?"
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: "(sniff) Oh god! Smells of decomposing
    navel!"
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: Ha!  My tonics are not
    for such weaklings as these!
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: In my professional opinion,
    nothing can be done for such sorry patients!
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: Why bother? You are all
    little more than meat.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: My instincts are dulled...
    it is this blasted gloom.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: "... Perhaps you should
    seek a second opinion."
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: No. "Auribus teneo
    lupum," as they say.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: Unpack my supplies here?
    With creatures about!?
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: No. My chemicals will
    attract the enemy.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: There's no time for that!
    They are nearly here!
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: I dub it "yersinia
    pestis." Yes. A fine name.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: I cannot. I am too
    far behind on my note-taking.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: I approach thee, fingers
    smeared with aconite...
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: "... I prescribe
    two parts placebo, one part hardship."
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: Sometimes blood is
    just as useful outside as in.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: Preventing injury
    is not my area of study.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: Absolutely not. These
    formulae are too valuable.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: They would try to copy
    my work. I cannot risk that.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: No... no, I must save
    my supplies. For later...
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: No. My supplies are not
    unlimited.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: Mmmmm... treatment is
    unnecessary. Carry on.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: "(sigh) My time is too
    valuable for these trivialities!"
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: You are unschooled, yes?
    Then I must decline.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: I'll not risk sullying my
    physique with your bumbling efforts!
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: You would make a poor
    battlefield physician...
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: Save your arts... This
    patient is too far gone.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: "(incoherent muttering)"
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: 13, 14, 15, 16, excise
    the heart, the liver, the spleen...
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: No thank you. I am training
    my immunity.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: I prefer a good bleeding.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: This is not medicine. It's
    another of your fandangos.
  plague_doctor+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: I've no patience for your...
    nostrums.
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: "(laughs softly) I'll not deny
    my body its final rest."
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: We have failed. But our bodies
    will feed so, so many...
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: Coat thyself in this ointment.
    It will restore your courage!
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: Craven fool! Do you not see
    that death is a beginning?
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: Every wound is the genesis
    of a new world.
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: No. I am testing my new pain-relieving
    tonic.
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: Oh yes. And in our haste, we
    would simply abandon the loot.
  plague_doctor+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: And you'll come collect the loot
    later, I bet. Ha!
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_depressed_0: My wounds are my own.
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_depressed_1: The cortex has already failed. Why spare
    the corpus?
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_depressed_2: There is no saving me. The wound already
    festers.
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_irrational_0: One germ helping another? Hah!
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Tiny animals under glass... Smaller than
    sand...
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_irrational_2: Healing IS the disease, I tell you!
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_masochistic_0: Leave me - the pain fuels my focus.
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: Stay back. I am cultivating this wound...
    for science.
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: The body's natural healing will suffice
    today.
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: I know medicine...I recognize a knife in
    the back!
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: Get away from me! Have you not trained
    at all?
  plague_doctor+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: Thank you, but may I recommend a career
    as a butcher?
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_depressed_0: There is no cure for the broken spirit...
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_depressed_1: I am too far gone... You waste your materials.
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_irrational_0: CAREFUL! I have been running an experiment
    here!
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_irrational_1: The black plague runs even this far.
    I can smell it.
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_masochistic_0: I can heal myself, thank you.
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Stop! I am testing a theory!
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_paranoid_0: "... Did you wash that?"
  plague_doctor+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Ew, no. It may have... germs.
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_abusive_0: Stop pestering me! Or I shall poison your
    grog!
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_abusive_1: You share my air too willingly. It is your
    loss, fool...
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_fearful_0: The black breath... It goes in once, then
    nevermore...
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_fearful_1: The physiology of terror has gripped me.
    I cannot.
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_irrational_0: Wounds heal slowly... Corruption moves
    quickly...
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_irrational_1: What is the speed of nature? Is there
    a fixed rate?
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_masochistic_0: There is a foul breeze where I stand.
    I must learn its nature.
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_masochistic_1: No. I must keep these wounds out of
    the light. So they... improve.
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Detestable urchin! I'll not fall prey to
    your... guile!
  plague_doctor+str_block_move_paranoid_1: I'd rather keep you where I can see you...
  plague_doctor+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Yes... My special batch is taking effect.
    (chuckle)
  plague_doctor+str_buff_party_powerful_1: Such power... It has infected us all.
  plague_doctor+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: Yes... I see my tonic is finally
    taking effect.
  plague_doctor+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: And now you see the power
    of my ministrations. Go forth.
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: Leave me to wither...
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: Death's cold embrace entraps my soul.
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: I withdraw, as an owl from the dawn.
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: Death reaches for me!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: No... I am not prepared!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Their corruption is overwhelming!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: You'll not have my formulae! They
    are MINE! MIIIIIINE!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: My secrets are my own! Stay back!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: They know I can wield plague and corruption!
    They hate me!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: I won't be the one who ends up on the
    pile!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Shield me while I concoct another batch!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: I must update my notes!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: I'm just another body for the pile.
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: There is no avoiding the coming death.
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: Finally... my turn to meet the Reaper.
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: Coughing, choking, prodding, poking...
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: 5, 6, 7, 8, store the bodies in a
    crate...
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Medice -- cura te ipsum!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: I've seen a lifetime of horrors
    - come on then!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: What doesn't kill you, makes you
    stronger!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: One more dance with death!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: Let me through, I'm a doctor!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Step aside! Let a professional demonstrate!
  plague_doctor+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: I must make a record of their death!
    For science!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Butcher! Absolutely no precision
    at all.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: You make a better patient than
    a surgeon...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Quickly! Staunch the bleeding!
    And get me leeches!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Excuse me - where is the
    apothecary? I've run out of mold.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Don't damage the brain! I need
    a sample!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Don't cut it up! I need it
    whole for my experiments!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: No, NO! Where is your passion?
    Where is your focus?!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: I can see your potential!
    And yet you spurn it!?
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: Death and dying feels so
    different on the receiving end...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: You failed. And now death
    comes for us all.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: Two... yes two... two
    drops amaranth... NO, THREE!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: Tiny creatures... infinitesimal
    small... Too small to see!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: Your deception has been
    found out. Traitor!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: Your trickery stands out
    like a rotting wound!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: Gods. Move over. Let me
    show you how a professional does it.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: You lack expertise, clearly.
    I can train you, for a fee...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: "... You would be worth more to me
    as a cadaver."
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: So many useful organs... all wasted
    on you.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: Death is coming. The all-devourer,
    the all-destroyer...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: Here I am, death! CONSUME ME!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: Scrape out that wound and save
    it in this jar for me.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: I smell gangrene about you. Like
    expensive perfume.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Work your evil on me, villain!
    I crave the knowledge of it!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: No, me, me! I need wounds to feed
    my experiments!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: That one is diseased! I see all the
    signs!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: Smell that? ALMOND! THEY ARE POISONOUS!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: I saw greatness in my future...
    Now I see shadow!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: If we die, donate my body to the
    university.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: Bones are like stone... MADE
    of stone... Shatter like stone!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: Pop the skull. Drain the fluid.
    Find release...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: How could they have missed? It
    defies all sense...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: I am no fool. You have paid them
    to spare you. Deny it!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: I cannot die... Please! I have yet
    to prove myself!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: This should not be possible! My recipe
    must be incorrect!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: The lob-lolly is dead! The lob-lolly
    is DEAD! (moan)
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: The blood is black... Scorched
    by sickness...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: Yes... feed my blood to the crawling
    things!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: Fools. If my blood were to somehow
    penetrate your flesh...
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: They can't be real! A hallucination!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: I am weak... They have poison breath!
    Can you smell it?
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: Dammit! My vials are broken! That
    will cost extra!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: This was my favorite smock. Now you
    shall perish.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: What?! But I warded against you!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: Dammit! My repelling tonic isn't
    working!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: Split the skin. Break the ribs.
    Remove the lung.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: A rare specimen indeed. Drain
    it and seal it in wax.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: No... Kill me! Save me from
    myself!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: This death could be quick.
    A luxury in these times.
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: I am attracting them somehow!
    My vapors must be off!
  plague_doctor+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: Foul creature! It knows my power!
  plague_doctor+str_critbyhero_0: Look how they wither and die!
  plague_doctor+str_critbyhero_1: One more cadaver for the cart.
  plague_doctor+str_critbyhero_2: Become as dust!
  plague_doctor+str_critbyhero_3: Excise the tumor!
  plague_doctor+str_critbyhero_4: I'll keep this bit for later!
  plague_doctor+str_critbyhero_5: Bones break and flesh tears!
  plague_doctor+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: Another victory for the lymphatic glands.
  plague_doctor+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: No one may kill that which defies death.
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: We're all infested with rotteness,
    anyway.
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: I see disembodied eyes... floating
    in arsenic...
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: And so my organs, too, shall adorn
    a university shelf...
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: I... I am afraid!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: N-no!  I must consult my notes...
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: So c-c-cold... can't focus!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: Ring around the rosie, pocket full
    of posie...
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: No mortal can flee the black wind...
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: 'Here is the colour of death: light
    inverted.'
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_irrational_3: 9, 10, 11, 12, in mind and body,
    I must delve...
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: Toxic conspiracies - I smell betrayal!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: I must protect my formulae from prying
    eyes!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: I demand a second opinion!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: Keep back - I'm quarantined!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: It's my life! I'll decide how to spend
    it!
  plague_doctor+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: That would compromise my experiment!
  plague_doctor+str_mark_self_depressed_0: If I must die, I am taking you all with
    me!
  plague_doctor+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Approach! Approach, and know the Reaper
    as I have!
  plague_doctor+str_mark_self_irrational_0: 17, 18, 19, 20, splatter the ground with
    blood aplenty!
  plague_doctor+str_mark_self_irrational_1: We shall all know death. You sooner than
    others.
  plague_doctor+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: Injure me! I can heal any wound!
  plague_doctor+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: Stand forth! Test the strength of my
    physic!
  plague_doctor+str_monster_attack_unholy_curse: It whispers my doom. We are all but
    dust.
  plague_doctor+str_monster_attack_unholy_judgement: Even putting bones in the ground
    is no defense!
  plague_doctor+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: Aah! It raises blisters with a touch!
  plague_doctor+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: Not me! I am a learned
    scholar!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_abusive_0: Medicine marks a new age, ignorant barbarians!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_abusive_1: Yes, pray for salvation! Meanwhile,
    I will WORK for it!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_abusive_2: You rely overmuch on luck. I prefer
    truth!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_depressed_0: All my study, all for naught.
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_depressed_1: My work is a shambles! I have nothing
    to live for!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_depressed_2: I'd rather die than face my peers
    in disgrace...
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_irrational_0: Ignorant professors - you will respect
    my studies, I swear it!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_irrational_1: Pain is the kindling; death, fire.
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_irrational_2: Viscera painted on the cottage floor...
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_masochistic_0: Knowledge requires risk... and pain!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Nothing ventured, nothing gained!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_masochistic_2: I will go to any lengths to prove
    my theories!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_paranoid_0: I diagnose you all with treachery!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_paranoid_1: Do not doubt that I can smell your
    corruption.
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Vile turpitude! I defy you!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_selfish_0: I must be allowed to continue my researches!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_selfish_1: Nonsense! I shall not deviate from standard
    practice!
  plague_doctor+str_random_command_selfish_2: Not now! My work here is almost done!
  plague_doctor+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: You see? No physic alive can match
    my arts!
  plague_doctor+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Despair not! I will vaccinate
    you against the plague of evil!
  plague_doctor+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: I have truly mastered life and death.
  plague_doctor+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: The corpus responds! Wounds heal
    -- scars fade!
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_courageous_0: We can survive illness or injury!
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_courageous_1: Do not underestimate the body. It is virile.
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_focused_1: Armor is no defense against plague.
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_powerful_0: A special mixture for my many enemies!
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_powerful_1: I will heal this afflicted land.
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_stalwart_0: The prospect of death does not frighten me!
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_stalwart_1: Even the will benefits from the immune response!
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Ah... my tonics are taking effect.
  plague_doctor+str_virtued_vigorous_1: Even steel cannot pierce a healthy immune
    system!
vestal:
  vestal+str_afflicted_abusive_0: I am chosen - you are nothing!
  vestal+str_afflicted_abusive_1: May the Light bring courage to you pathetic cast-offs!
  vestal+str_afflicted_abusive_2: Stop soiling yourself and fight!
  vestal+str_afflicted_abusive_3: Blasphemers! You offend my ears AND my eyes!
  vestal+str_afflicted_abusive_4: That I should be made to breathe the air AND your
    stink.. Appalling!
  vestal+str_afflicted_depressed_0: There is no higher purpose here...
  vestal+str_afflicted_depressed_1: This mission frays my spirits...
  vestal+str_afflicted_depressed_2: Why does everyone hate me? Even the mother superior...
  vestal+str_afflicted_depressed_3: Even the destitute of spirit refuse the Light.
    Why?
  vestal+str_afflicted_depressed_4: 'Verse LXVIII: Pray to the Light, for it will
    grant you joy...'
  vestal+str_afflicted_fearful_0: I am not up to this task, Light forgive me!
  vestal+str_afflicted_fearful_1: I will not fear martyrdom. I will not!
  vestal+str_afflicted_fearful_2: Light, grant me passage through these cursed halls…
  vestal+str_afflicted_fearful_3: 'Verse XXI: Heathens alone fear death...'
  vestal+str_afflicted_fearful_4: Spare me this one time, oh Light. Please spare me...
  vestal+str_afflicted_irrational_0: There is Light in the stones! And in the smiles
    of flies!
  vestal+str_afflicted_irrational_1: My eyes are on fire... So beautiful, I must gouge
    them out!
  vestal+str_afflicted_irrational_2: The Versebook is in my hand. I tear a bit and
    eat it. Mmm.
  vestal+str_afflicted_irrational_3: 'Verse XVI: the meek shall... Lords, this scroll
    is heavy.'
  vestal+str_afflicted_irrational_4: Fetch me a newborn lamb. I must make an offering.
    Now!
  vestal+str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Through suffering, I will know my faith!
  vestal+str_afflicted_masochistic_1: 'Verse XIII: only the faithless fear death.'
  vestal+str_afflicted_masochistic_2: My mortified flesh armors me against your hate!
  vestal+str_afflicted_masochistic_3: My blood is my penance. Take it, heretic!
  vestal+str_afflicted_masochistic_4: Ha! The Light has already burned away all feeling!
  vestal+str_afflicted_paranoid_0: You are all godless, luring me to my end!
  vestal+str_afflicted_paranoid_1: You test me? Shall I demonstrate the power of faith?
  vestal+str_afflicted_paranoid_2: Stop staring at me. I know your mind!
  vestal+str_afflicted_paranoid_3: 'Verse XXV: trust not armed men, for they seek
    to wound.'
  vestal+str_afflicted_paranoid_4: You mock me behind my back! Do not deny it!
  vestal+str_afflicted_selfish_0: The Light guides me, and only me.
  vestal+str_afflicted_selfish_1: Pay a donation to the church and I will bless your
    weapon.
  vestal+str_afflicted_selfish_2: Cast aside your gods. Mine alone is the one holy
    Light.
  vestal+str_afflicted_selfish_3: Give me your jewels and I will absolve you of idolatry.
  vestal+str_afflicted_selfish_4: Collection plate! Please give freely!
  vestal+str_attack_friendly_abusive_0: Unholy wretch! I will teach you some propriety!
  vestal+str_attack_friendly_abusive_1: Burn! Burn in effigy to the Light!
  vestal+str_attack_friendly_irrational_0: The fire burns within me! I wield it like
    a blade!
  vestal+str_attack_friendly_irrational_1: You all seek my virtue! But it is not mine
    to give!
  vestal+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_0: I will not sit idly by and wait for your
    betrayal!
  vestal+str_attack_friendly_paranoid_1: I can smell deceit. I've lived among much
    worse than you!
  vestal+str_attack_self_depressed_0: I care not about judgment... I tire of slavery.
  vestal+str_attack_self_depressed_1: Flame, consume me.
  vestal+str_attack_self_irrational_0: FIRE AND DEATH!
  vestal+str_attack_self_irrational_1: I will be no mother, "superior" or otherwise...
  vestal+str_attack_self_masochistic_0: The Flame grants power through sacrifice!
  vestal+str_attack_self_masochistic_1: Hear me, Flame! This blood is yours! Now grant
    me POWER!
  vestal+str_bark_deathsdoor: I am ready, Light!
  vestal+str_bark_encourage_0: Breathe from this censer and recite the Verses. Now!
  vestal+str_bark_encourage_1: 'Verse XXXVI: the Light shines brightest in darkness.'
  vestal+str_bark_encourage_2: I anoint you with oil warmed by the holy Flame. All
    is well.
  vestal+str_bark_first_aid_0: The ashes of this incense will consecrate the wound.
  vestal+str_bark_first_aid_1: You very nearly entered the Light. Be more careful.
  vestal+str_bark_first_aid_2: I will petition the Light for your quick recovery.
  vestal+str_bark_hobby_0: Busy yourself elsewhere. I am praying for your soul.
  vestal+str_bark_hobby_1: Yes, I shave my legs. What of it?
  vestal+str_bark_hobby_2: Have you thread? I've torn a seam in my temple garments.
  vestal+str_bark_pep_talk_0: The Light touches us even here.
  vestal+str_bark_pep_talk_1: I see victory in your eyes, though you are blind to
    it.
  vestal+str_bark_pep_talk_2: 'Verse LVI: The Light e''er rises.'
  vestal+str_bark_stress_abusive_0: God favors not the meek! Find some courage or
    burden me no more!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_abusive_1: Light forsake you, you fiends!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_abusive_2: Burn and die, craven beasts!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_0: I'll strike you all down if you get in my
    way.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_1: Silence! I am praying for your worthless
    souls!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_abusive_2: Your rude tongues offend the Light. And me.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_0: The holy Verses no longer resonate, all
    is lost.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_1: Dark times, these. Demons and undead plague
    the land.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_depressed_2: The holy flame flickers. 'Tis a black omen.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_0: These shadows are unnatural - unholy!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_1: I have had a vision! Our deaths are imminent!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_fearful_2: The holy Flame whispers of torture and misery!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_0: That Sister Abigail... always a cheat.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_1: Lord, this chastity belt chafes. Pass
    the lamp oil.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_irrational_2: Mutilation is a most holy act. Any takers?
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_0: Pain is the gateway to divinity!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic_1: We die today. Consumed in the Flame of
    hope.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_0: Conspiracy, all around me...
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_1: Something disrupts my prayer. An unholy
    presence...
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_2: 'Verse XII: quick-burning fires herald pain
    and torture.'
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid_3: Don't deny your lust, it's… fully apparent.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_0: I alone hold this pitiful group together.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_1: Yes, ten percent for the church! This was
    discussed!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_camp_selfish_2: Give your share to the Light and all will
    be forgiven.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_depressed_0: Why have I been abandoned?
  vestal+str_bark_stress_depressed_1: 'Verse XXXIV: pride is the path to foolishness...'
  vestal+str_bark_stress_depressed_2: I feel cold. Dark...
  vestal+str_bark_stress_fearful_0: Has the Light forsaken us?
  vestal+str_bark_stress_fearful_1: Deliver me, oh holy Flame...
  vestal+str_bark_stress_fearful_2: The shadows are crawling. This place is alive
    with evil!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_irrational_1: My flesh turns black! My eyes splinter!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_irrational_2: You are but children! Motherless children!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_masochistic_0: Only through pain shall we know forgiveness!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_masochistic_1: The pain only proves my devotion!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_masochistic_2: Only the unfaithful fear death!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_paranoid_0: That stone...it gazes at me!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_paranoid_1: Must watch their eyes. They all know of my vows...
  vestal+str_bark_stress_paranoid_2: There is a presence here. Dark and foul.
  vestal+str_bark_stress_selfish_0: Surely the Light has grander plans for me?
  vestal+str_bark_stress_selfish_1: Your grunting and crying is disturbing my focus!
  vestal+str_bark_stress_selfish_2: Silence, all! I will now sing a battle hymn!
  vestal+str_block_buff_depressed_0: There is nothing without the Light.
  vestal+str_block_buff_depressed_1: Stop. I am tainted enough already...
  vestal+str_block_buff_depressed_2: With every touch or glance, my resolve is corrupted...
  vestal+str_block_buff_irrational_0: I cannot accept help from the faithless...
  vestal+str_block_buff_irrational_1: I descend into the black lake below. I am lost...
  vestal+str_block_buff_irrational_2: Horrors! The Flame turns glaucous and crepuscular!
  vestal+str_block_buff_masochistic_0: The Light demands my blood!
  vestal+str_block_buff_masochistic_1: Stay back! My power wanes grows as my wounds
    mount!
  vestal+str_block_buff_masochistic_2: Save your blessings! The Light relishes in
    my suffering!
  vestal+str_block_buff_paranoid_0: Don't touch me! The Darkness works through you!
  vestal+str_block_buff_paranoid_1: 'Verse XII: Forbid thyself from incurring debts!'
  vestal+str_block_buff_paranoid_2: I cannot trust you!
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_0: Why do they scoff at the Verses? Do I
    misrepresent them?
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_depressed_1: Not unlike the last meal of an unchaste
    vestal...
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_0: Temptation is a wild snake; its venom,
    my release.
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_irrational_1: I'll not eat that! It swarms with dragonflies!
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_0: '"Going without" is the chief tenet
    of vestalhood...'
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_masochistic_1: I decline. The Light shall nourish
    me.
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_0: The Verses forbid me to eat this... whatever
    this is.
  vestal+str_block_camping_meal_paranoid_1: The Verses say nothing about fuzzy bread...
    hmmm...
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_0: I'll not lay my hands upon you...
    defilers.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_1: Oh? Shall I next bless the innkeeper's
    wench?
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive_2: The Light prescribes my blessings
    upon the worthy alone!
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_0: No blessing in the world will
    make any difference now.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_1: 'Verse LXI: Always know --
    never exceed -- thy limits.'
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed_2: The Light cannot illuminate
    one shrouded in black...
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_0: I... I cannot read the ritual
    while I shudder so...
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_1: I am trying... but the Light
    denies a disquieted soul.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful_2: There's no time for that. Evil
    is drawn to my purity.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_0: My versebook pages flutter
    on the wind - like butterflies!
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_1: They whipped us in the Convent,
    day and night...
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational_2: I am tired, and the sunset
    is beautiful, is it not?
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_0: A brush with death can truly
    purify the spirit.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_1: The Mother Superior would
    be right to impose ten lashings instead...
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic_2: In my life, suffering has
    been a potent motivator...
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_0: And reveal my secrets? I think
    not.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_1: "... No. This is intimacy masquerading
    as aid."
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid_2: I'll not sully my virtue like
    that. It's... improper.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_0: I am quite used to keeping what
    is mine, thank you.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_1: 'Verse VI: Preserve thine own
    virtue above all else.'
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish_2: Feh!  Only the light can guide
    my actions!
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_0: I see you worrying that stone.
    That is idolatry.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive_1: Ugh. And will you read my palm
    next, you vile peddler?
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_0: My life, wasted.  There is no
    power in faith.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed_1: I have defied so many Verses...
    It is futility.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_0: I can't hear you, I've fled
    this place on wings of light!
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational_1: I-I've lost a page...it sits
    atop the steeple, hee hee hee!
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_0: Pain is a gift from the holy
    Flame. I cherish it.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic_1: I can take more yet. Save your
    folksy charms.
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_0: 'Verse CXI: The pure shall refuse
    all strangers'' gifts.'
  vestal+str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid_1: We are becoming too familiar.
    I shall cope alone.
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_0: What cowardice.
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_depressed_1: No. I shall at least die with some
    dignity.
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_0: HOLD YOUR GROUND! YOU SHAME THE FIRE!
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_irrational_1: FLEE NOW, YES! AND MAY THE FIRE DAMN
    YOUR COWARD SOUL!
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_0: These marks reveal my faith.
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic_1: The Flame fears nothing -- no pain,
    no defeat.
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_0: And betray my honor? Is that what you
    want?
  vestal+str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid_1: My virtue far outweighs your falsity.
    So we stay.
  vestal+str_block_heal_depressed_0: This is my destiny, let me be.
  vestal+str_block_heal_depressed_1: I am well enough. Go, help the others.
  vestal+str_block_heal_depressed_2: 'Verse CXV: when health wanes, only prayer can
    restore it.'
  vestal+str_block_heal_irrational_0: It's full of stars - beautiful and horrifying!
  vestal+str_block_heal_irrational_1: Nonsense! I need only bay leaf and cow urine!
  vestal+str_block_heal_irrational_2: The whip. The cat. The lash. The scourge.
  vestal+str_block_heal_masochistic_1: Take your hands off me... unless you seek to
    wound me further!
  vestal+str_block_heal_masochistic_2: My vows demand I refuse. You wouldn't understand.
  vestal+str_block_heal_paranoid_0: Don't touch me! The Devil works through you!
  vestal+str_block_heal_paranoid_1: The Light is quite enough for me, thank you.
  vestal+str_block_heal_paranoid_2: I deny your shamanism, kind though it may seem.
  vestal+str_block_item_depressed_0: If the Flame cannot suffice, then the Flame has
    done with me.
  vestal+str_block_item_depressed_1: The power of virtue will save me... I hope.
  vestal+str_block_item_irrational_0: I don't need anything, not even my faith! Hahaha...
  vestal+str_block_item_irrational_1: I have known much darkness. But this seems so
    very... inky!
  vestal+str_block_item_masochistic_0: I thrive on pain. It's the way of my order.
  vestal+str_block_item_masochistic_1: Let me endure it a bit first. It rejuvenates
    my soul.
  vestal+str_block_item_paranoid_0: Why? To tarnish my pure soul? You are jealous!
  vestal+str_block_item_paranoid_1: Stand away! Faith alone will heal me!
  vestal+str_block_move_abusive_0: Don't touch me! I know your.. type.
  vestal+str_block_move_abusive_1: Oh yes, a simple touch on the shoulder now. But
    what later?
  vestal+str_block_move_fearful_0: The sacred Flame flickers... The path falls to
    darkness.
  vestal+str_block_move_fearful_1: 'Verse LXI: When all is lost, stand firm. The Flame
    endures.'
  vestal+str_block_move_irrational_0: You touched me... you touched me... you touched
    me...
  vestal+str_block_move_irrational_1: Your heat... it is noticeable... Does the Flame
    also feel?
  vestal+str_block_move_masochistic_0: No. The Flame tests my fear of death. I must
    face it.
  vestal+str_block_move_masochistic_1: My resolve is weak here. I must train it more
    fully
  vestal+str_block_move_paranoid_0: Ha! I see your mind! Stay there, you... filthy
    lech.
  vestal+str_block_move_paranoid_1: Oh, yes, any chance to brush by the virgin. I
    see.
  vestal+str_buff_party_powerful_0: Our actions have pleased the sacred Flame.
  vestal+str_buff_party_powerful_1: This is a holy boon. Use it wisely.
  vestal+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_0: What grace has given me, let it pass
    to you, hero.
  vestal+str_buff_random_party_member_focused_1: The sacred fire whispers your name.
    You are most blessed.
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_depressed_0: I am unworthy. I cannot carry the Light.
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_depressed_1: I cannot lead. I am too... inexperienced.
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_depressed_2: Take my place. You are stronger than I.
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_fearful_0: The Light is eclipsed!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_fearful_1: No! NOOO! They are too strong!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_fearful_2: Get back! Their eyes are cold with murder!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_0: They will sell us to slavers if they defeat
    us!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_1: Ugh! Their foul taint is anathema to my virtue!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_paranoid_2: Sin swirls about them... Do not breathe their
    air!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_selfish_0: The Light... commands me to serve in other
    ways.
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_selfish_1: Curses, my hair is tangled in my gorget! A
    moment!
  vestal+str_change_pos_back_selfish_2: I can't read the Verses in this light! Ah,
    that's better.
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_0: My faith... is a lie.
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_1: Why slow the inevitable? Damnation awaits
    me.
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_depressed_2: What is the point of life, of faith?
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_0: The verses number 36 and so too the constellations!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_1: There is music in the air! LA, LA-LOO, LA-LOOEEOOOAAA!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_irrational_2: Take my arm, like the ladies on the promenade!
    Weee!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_0: I am the Light's martyr - strike me down!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_1: You cannot harm me! I bear the holy Flame!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_masochistic_2: Their lashes will fuel the hearth within!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_0: I am chosen!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_1: Their souls must suffer the flame!
  vestal+str_change_pos_fwd_selfish_2: I cannot see the enemy! Move over!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_0: Impressive. But the sacred fire grants
    superior power.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_abusive_1: "... I could do better. Given half
    a chance."
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_0: Mother - Father!  Too late!  The
    convent has taken me...
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_irrational_1: Hah!  Even the pigs of St. Martha's
    can carry that tune!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_0: Let me kill it! Its soul must perish
    by my hand!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_hit_selfish_1: Leave that one to me! I must cauterize
    its existence!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_0: Eight year-old girls in the convent
    are better trained...
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_abusive_1: I could fight better in my temple
    garments...
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_0: No! NOOOO! Keep away from me!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_fearful_1: Now I know my end has come....
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_0: But I am only a child. How can
    you ask that of me... How...
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_irrational_1: 'I ask thee, oh Flame: is it
    privilege... or slavery?'
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_0: I know a liar when I see one.
    You missed on purpose!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_paranoid_1: Traitor! You could not have missed
    so easily! TRAITOR!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_0: You know, for a donation, the Flame
    may grant you skill.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_attack_missed_selfish_1: Yes, distract that one while I
    do the real work.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_0: I am ashamed to be in your presence.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_abusive_1: How uninspiring you are. Sigh.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_0: No... No, please... (bursts into sobs)
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_fearful_1: "(tears streaming) Spare me... spare me...
    spare me..."
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_0: You will burn for that. .. BUUURRRRRRRRNNNNNN!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_irrational_1: "(sobbing uncontrollably)"
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_0: Yes... Your pain makes you powerful.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_masochistic_1: No! Take me instead! I... I have sinned
    so grievously!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_0: Someone has trained them... We have been
    tricked!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_hit_paranoid_1: You LET yourself be hit... Why would that
    be?
  vestal+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_0: I have known despair. Yet the fear of
    imminent death... (shudder)
  vestal+str_comment_ally_missed_fearful_1: Gods, how I long for the safety of the
    convent...
  vestal+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_0: I hear the song of the sisterhood.
    The burning women...
  vestal+str_comment_ally_missed_irrational_1: You too shall burn. There is no escape.
  vestal+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_0: I know a liar when I see one. They missed
    on purpose!
  vestal+str_comment_ally_missed_paranoid_1: Traitor! They could not have missed so
    easily! TRAITOR!
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_0: Flame... oh Flame... why do you forsake me?
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_fearful_1: I have been so very faithful! And yet...
    now I suffer!?
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_0: Mother! MOTHER!
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_irrational_1: Please! Be kind to me, Sisters!
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_0: "(deep inhale) Yes... again!"
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_masochistic_1: It hurts, yes... But also... (blesses
    herself)
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_0: They know I serve the fire! They seek my
    death!
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_paranoid_1: I KNOW them! They are foes of the Flame!
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_0: For that, I claim your soul! FOR THE FLAME!
  vestal+str_comment_self_hit_selfish_1: Ungh! For these injuries, I require a greater
    fee!
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_0: No! No, please, NOOO!
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_fearful_1: Leave me be! PLEASE!
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_0: The hissing embers... like a choir
    of the faithful.
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_irrational_1: I am aFlame -- a beacon to the devout.
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_0: Please, please! End this life of slavery!
    I BEG YOU!
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_masochistic_1: NOOO! The Flame calls to me! Send
    me to the Flame!
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_0: My purity is attracting them! They can
    smell it!
  vestal+str_comment_self_missed_paranoid_1: I like not how that one is looking at
    me!
  vestal+str_critbyhero_0: Light take you!
  vestal+str_critbyhero_1: Blacken our world no longer!
  vestal+str_critbyhero_2: Begone, foul thing!
  vestal+str_critbyhero_3: You shall suffer as I have!
  vestal+str_critbyhero_4: Burn in the holy Flame!
  vestal+str_critbyhero_5: You are DAMNED!
  vestal+str_heal_self_vigorous_0: As mother said... my suffering has prepared me
    well.
  vestal+str_heal_self_vigorous_1: No ill wind can snuff out the sacred Flame.
  vestal+str_ignore_command_depressed_0: Where there is no Light, there can be no
    hope...
  vestal+str_ignore_command_depressed_1: Shhh... not even the Light can save us now.
  vestal+str_ignore_command_depressed_2: Call down the Flame yourself. It heeds me
    no longer.
  vestal+str_ignore_command_fearful_0: Dark whispers bind me!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_fearful_1: Blackness... so much paralyzing blackness...
  vestal+str_ignore_command_fearful_2: I... I can't move... Light protect me!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_irrational_0: It was a beautiful hymn, sung by the pigs
    of St. Martha's.
  vestal+str_ignore_command_irrational_1: My gloves are soiled, and they in turn soil
    the holy pages!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_irrational_2: A candle in the dark! Burn, burn, BURN!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_paranoid_0: I alone am the bearer of the Light!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_paranoid_1: The Verses command patience! I'll not defy
    them!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_paranoid_2: The darkness plays tricks, I will hold fast.
  vestal+str_ignore_command_selfish_0: My faith alone is the measure of purity!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_selfish_1: I walk my own path!
  vestal+str_ignore_command_selfish_2: No. The time is not yet right.
  vestal+str_mark_self_depressed_0: I will burn in blackness... And so shall you!
  vestal+str_mark_self_depressed_1: Join me! Join me in the black world, denizens
    of evil!
  vestal+str_mark_self_irrational_0: Demons, all. You, my mother, my father... all.
  vestal+str_mark_self_irrational_1: Anoint yourself with my holy blood, and be damned.
  vestal+str_mark_self_masochistic_0: I sacrifice myself for the good of the Light!
  vestal+str_mark_self_masochistic_1: My blood will purify you!
  vestal+str_monster_attack_unholy_smite: "(gasp) It steals my breath!"
  vestal+str_monster_user_selected_targets_kill_pill: I-it's too horrible! Noooo!
  vestal+str_random_command_abusive_0: You are faithless, but the Light gives me strength!
  vestal+str_random_command_abusive_1: I banish you, demons!
  vestal+str_random_command_abusive_2: Holy Flame, cauterize the wound of their existence!
  vestal+str_random_command_depressed_0: I am just a shadow in the dark - nothing
    at all.
  vestal+str_random_command_depressed_1: I am no hero! Just a little girl in a woman's
    garb!
  vestal+str_random_command_depressed_2: Poor experience begets poor decisions...
  vestal+str_random_command_irrational_0: The stars and sun are of the same Light,
    yet I see neither...
  vestal+str_random_command_irrational_1: One stunted tree in a fruiting orchard...
  vestal+str_random_command_irrational_2: The Flame flickers...
  vestal+str_random_command_irrational_3: I see now... Shadows are the children of
    Light...
  vestal+str_random_command_masochistic_0: I relish my trials, I relish my wounds!
  vestal+str_random_command_masochistic_1: Spill my blood! Its purity shall exorcise
    you!
  vestal+str_random_command_masochistic_2: I hurl myself on the altar of faith!
  vestal+str_random_command_paranoid_0: Cowards!  You reject the Light!
  vestal+str_random_command_paranoid_1: I can decide for myself! I am no scullery
    girl!
  vestal+str_random_command_paranoid_2: Hands off! I command myself, thank you!
  vestal+str_random_command_selfish_0: The Light's rewards are for me alone!
  vestal+str_random_command_selfish_1: My power came at a great price. I use it as
    I wish.
  vestal+str_random_command_selfish_2: The Light alone commands me. None else have
    the right.
  vestal+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_0: The fire stands with you. Fear not the
    black.
  vestal+str_stress_heal_party_courageous_1: Do not despair. As the black deepens,
    my power grows...
  vestal+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_0: I cannot be extinguished when fire burns
    within.
  vestal+str_stress_heal_self_stalwart_1: Power is purity!
  vestal+str_virtued_courageous_0: Worry not, friends. We are protected from above!
  vestal+str_virtued_courageous_1: The night is black, yes -- but the Fire burns bright.
  vestal+str_virtued_focused_0: My path is illuminated!
  vestal+str_virtued_focused_1: By the holy Flame, I shall persevere!
  vestal+str_virtued_powerful_0: Holy power courses through me!
  vestal+str_virtued_powerful_1: 'It is as the Versebook says: purity is power.'
  vestal+str_virtued_stalwart_0: My faith shall be my guide!
  vestal+str_virtued_stalwart_1: My purity shall burn away all blackness!
  vestal+str_virtued_vigorous_0: Though caged in steel, my faith burns through.
  vestal+str_virtued_vigorous_1: I set my soul aflame. Nothing can extinguish it.
rest:
  bark_effective_difficulty: THIS DUNGEON IS TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME!
  str_afflicted_fearful_0: How can one stand against all of this?
  str_afflicted_fearful_1: We are doomed!
  str_afflicted_masochistic_0: Let the pain come! I will soak it in!
  str_afflicted_masochistic_1: I revel in despair!
  str_affliction_description_abusive: Anger flows forth into action. Might is survival.
    The weak must fall.
  str_affliction_description_depressed: Cast off, adrift, in a dark sea amongst jagged
    rocks.
  str_affliction_description_fearful: Fear has overwhelmed the hero, whose every thought
    is now turned to self-preservation.
  str_affliction_description_irrational: Two and two make three while six and seven
    break free.
  str_affliction_description_masochistic: Pain is pleasure to the Just, to the Willing,
    to the Surivor.
  str_affliction_description_paranoid: Wolves lie in wait behind every tree; diseases
    are in every meal; avarice behind every friend.
  str_affliction_description_selfish: "“I say let the world go to hell, but I should
    always have my tea.”"
  str_alcoholism_brothel_rejection: Just get me a pint and I'll be right as rain.
  str_alcoholism_flagellation_rejection: That seems a bit bloody. How 'bout a stiff
    drink instead.
  str_alcoholism_gambling_rejection: A stiff drink is all I need.
  str_alcoholism_meditation_rejection: A pint will give me the peace I need.
  str_alcoholism_prayer_rejection: Bah!  I want to drink and be merry!
  str_ancestor_description: A shimmering likeness of your Ancestor! He wishes to speak...
  str_attack_friendly_abusive: Weakling, coward!
  str_attack_friendly_irrational: "(insensible wailing)"
  str_attack_friendly_paranoid: You! It was you all along!
  str_attack_self_depressed: No... I will not go on!
  str_attack_self_irrational: RRRAAAAAAAH!
  str_attack_self_masochistic: Yes, YES! More pain, MORE BLOOD!
  str_bar_committed_0: Bring the whole bottle. This will not be a short night.
  str_bar_committed_1: I am parched, sir!
  str_bar_committed_2: Make it a double, and keep them coming!
  str_bar_committed_3: Bring me something that will burn my throat!
  str_bar_committed_4: Drink and dance a merry jig! Tonight we are still alive!
  str_bar_committed_5: Let us raise our glasses - to life, and to sorrow!
  str_bar_committed_6: This round is on me!
  str_bark_abandon_hope: Why should we fret? We'll all be worms soon enough.
  str_bark_accelerated_stall_0: We need to finish this fight quickly!
  str_bark_accelerated_stall_1: If we tarry, surely more will come!
  str_bark_accelerated_stall_2: Do not toy with this one! It may signal for more.
  str_bark_accelerated_stall_3: Let us be done with this rabble!
  str_bark_anger_management: You have nothing to fear, my friends. The beast is not
    for you.
  str_bark_arrested: I've made a huge mistake.
  str_bark_backingup_0: Careful!
  str_bark_backingup_1: Stay calm! This is not a rout!
  str_bark_backingup_2: Stop stepping on my feet!
  str_bark_backingup_3: What if we're ambushed like this?!
  str_bark_backingup_4: Is anyone checking behind us?
  str_bark_bandits_sense: With my ear to the road, none shall surprise us...
  str_bark_battle_trance: "<chants>"
  str_bark_bigwound_0: My wounds are mounting.
  str_bark_bigwound_1: Heal me!
  str_bark_bigwound_2: Unnngh!
  str_bark_bigwound_3: I need a healer!
  str_bark_bigwound_4: Argh!
  str_bark_bigwound_5: Blast!
  str_bark_bigwound_6: Yaargh!
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_0: Steady, my friend!
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_1: Shake it off!
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_2: Do not fall!
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_3: W-what grievous injury!
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_4: Brace up!
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_5: Are you alright?
  str_bark_bigwound_ally_6: Steel yourself!
  str_bark_bleeddot_0: Can't staunch the flow...
  str_bark_bleeddot_1: There will be no blood left for the leeches!
  str_bark_bleeddot_2: Everything runs red...
  str_bark_bleeddot_3: So much...blood...
  str_bark_bleeddot_4: I need a bandage!
  str_bark_bleeddot_5: I...bleed...
  str_bark_bless: My friend, the Light shines upon you!
  str_bark_bloody_shroud: Truly, I am a wretched thing...
  str_bark_chant: "...Divine Light...Purest Grace...be with us now."
  str_bark_companionship_0: I am glad to face these dangers with all of you.
  str_bark_companionship_1: This reminds me of that time in the Weald--just without
    all the spiders.
  str_bark_companionship_2: This stonework is far older than the manor above. For
    what foul use were these halls laid?
  str_bark_companionship_3: We must be on our guard. I'll take first watch.
  str_bark_companionship_4: If we work together, we can overcome this evil.
  str_bark_companionship_5: Can anyone carry a tune?
  str_bark_companionship_6: Sleep calls. We'll need our strength.
  str_bark_curiobad_1: Curses!
  str_bark_curiobad_2: Should've known better...
  str_bark_curiobad_3: Fool me once...
  str_bark_curiobad_4: Blast it all...
  str_bark_curiogood_0: Excellent!
  str_bark_curiogood_1: Finally... something to smile about.
  str_bark_curiogood_2: A boon at last!
  str_bark_curiogood_3: Fortune smirks at least.
  str_bark_curiogood_4: Aha!
  str_bark_curiomeh_0: That could've been worse, I suppose.
  str_bark_curiomeh_1: Feh.
  str_bark_curiomeh_2: Better than a trap.
  str_bark_curiomeh_4: Moving on...
  str_bark_curious_incantation: The calmest of the temples prepare for hardship with
    this mantra.
  str_bark_dark_ritual: G'NATH ELDRATCHANAR F'THGYLL GRY'NDOT!
  str_bark_dark_strength: Let the eldritch powers course!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_0: I fear I'm lost!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_1: I see only swirling blackness!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_ally_0: No! Do not fall!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_ally_1: We will save you!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_ally_2: You cannot die. We need you!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_ally_3: Someone - HELP!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_ally_4: Back from the edge, comrade!
  str_bark_deathsdoor_ally_5: Hold fast!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_0: I'm not giving up!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_1: My vision clears!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_2: My thread winds on!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_3: The grave can wait!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_ally_0: My friend--you shall not fall today!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_ally_1: Hold fast, friend, you are still with us!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_ally_2: Easy, easy, you're not gone yet!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_ally_3: Stay with us!
  str_bark_deathsdoorsurvive_ally_4: You still stand, fight on!
  str_bark_eldritch_blood: There is no greater poison than what already flows in my
    veins.
  str_bark_encourage: Calm thyself, friend. We shall endure.
  str_bark_every_rose: Listen here - Every night has its dawn..
  str_bark_experimental_vapours: Inhale this...it *should* make you feel much better.
  str_bark_field_dressing: Even great wounds are treatable. Get back in this fight.
  str_bark_firewood_high_0: We could erect a cabin with all the lumber we are toting.
  str_bark_firewood_high_1: Perhaps a bonfire would frighten away the monsters.
  str_bark_firewood_high_2: We have the wood. Let us enjoy a warm fire.
  str_bark_firewood_high_3: "'Tis fortunate we have firewood. This place chills me..."
  str_bark_firewood_high_4: Save the wood for when we need it. Danger ahead.
  str_bark_firewood_low_0: We are out of firewood. We must steel ourselves for a push
    to the end.
  str_bark_firewood_low_1: There is nothing for it now. We've run out of wood.
  str_bark_firewood_low_2: No chance of foraging more timber now. Best press on.
  str_bark_firewood_low_3: That's it -- no sleep for us. We march to victory, or ruin.
  str_bark_firewood_low_4: We've used our last log. So that's the state of things.
  str_bark_first_aid: Let me tend to those wounds.
  str_bark_forage: A little sniff makes the day just that much better.
  str_bark_gallows_humor: How many adventurers does it take to die in a pit?
  str_bark_hounds_watch: I must rest now, girl. Your nose must guard us tonight.
  str_bark_how_its_done: Even towering beasts can be killed with a well-placed blow.
  str_bark_hp_heal_dot: Renewal!
  str_bark_hp_partyhigh_0: We are healthy and prepared for what may come.
  str_bark_hp_partyhigh_1: At least we have our health.
  str_bark_hp_partyhigh_2: Seems we are likely to survive. That's good, at least.
  str_bark_hp_partyhigh_3: No signs of illness or infected wounds. Good.
  str_bark_hp_partyhigh_4: At this rate, we should be home by dawn.
  str_bark_hp_partylow_0: Another battle may be the end of us.
  str_bark_hp_partylow_1: We shall not survive... of that, I'm sure.
  str_bark_hp_partylow_2: We have paid for our folly in blood...
  str_bark_hp_partylow_3: A terrible price. What awful hubris.
  str_bark_hp_partylow_4: We must go on... though our chances are small.
  str_bark_hp_selfhigh_0: I am ready for battle. Let them come.
  str_bark_hp_selfhigh_1: Plenty of blood left to shed this day.
  str_bark_hp_selfhigh_2: I can feel my heart. It pumps strong.
  str_bark_hp_selfhigh_3: I feel strong and powerful. Let us carry on!
  str_bark_hp_selfhigh_4: I am blessed with good health. For today, at least.
  str_bark_hp_selflow_0: My wounds are many and I feel weak.
  str_bark_hp_selflow_1: If I fall, don't leave my body here to rot.
  str_bark_hp_selflow_2: Just leave me here. I only slow you down.
  str_bark_hp_selflow_3: Is that fever...? Or am I merely bleeding out...
  str_bark_hp_selflow_4: I don't fancy my chances. Perhaps you could 'make it quick.'
  str_bark_increasingstress_0: This expedition is doomed!
  str_bark_increasingstress_1: This cannot continue...
  str_bark_increasingstress_10: I don't like this...
  str_bark_increasingstress_11: I-I don't want to die here!
  str_bark_increasingstress_12: It's over for us - over!
  str_bark_increasingstress_2: "*breathes heavily*"
  str_bark_increasingstress_3: I...this...can't...
  str_bark_increasingstress_4: We have seen such horrors already!
  str_bark_increasingstress_5: We shall not survive. This I know.
  str_bark_increasingstress_6: It gnaws at the back of my mind...
  str_bark_increasingstress_7: What are we doing?
  str_bark_increasingstress_8: W-we should run!
  str_bark_increasingstress_9: "*gasp!*"
  str_bark_instruction: Skill always trumps raw strength. Strike like so...
  str_bark_leeches: The leeches shall purify your blood.
  str_bark_let_the_mask_down: The draft of air upon my face...intoxicating...
  str_bark_maintain_equipment: Keep your harness polished, and it will not fail you.
  str_bark_marching_plan: If we learn to move in ordered fashion, we will fight better
    together.
  str_bark_mockery: Look at this fool, this imbecile!  Playing the hero, are you?!
    Ha-HAA
  str_bark_night_steps: I shall wander in the night. Don't wait up.
  str_bark_party_great_condition_0: We are healthy and mentally steeled for this challenge!
  str_bark_party_great_condition_1: We are favored by the gods this day.
  str_bark_party_great_condition_2: Blessed are we, that no fear has o'ertaken us.
  str_bark_party_great_condition_3: We are as straight-backed as a royal guard. Good.
  str_bark_party_great_condition_4: We are the flame!
  str_bark_party_poor_condition_0: Our wounds are many and even our courage hangs
    by a thread!
  str_bark_party_poor_condition_1: We have strayed too far, and we shall soon pay
    the price.
  str_bark_party_poor_condition_2: We must return to town... Please, listen to me!
  str_bark_party_poor_condition_3: I beg you... turn back! I have suffered and seen
    too much!
  str_bark_party_poor_condition_4: Hopeless. The mission is utterly hopeless.
  str_bark_pep_talk: Cheer up. Things will get better.
  str_bark_pet_the_hound: Whatever tomorrow brings, six legs are better than two.
  str_bark_pilfer: I...borrowed...this when we were in town.
  str_bark_planned_takedown: The bigger they are, the harder they will fall.
  str_bark_poisondot_0: My veins are on fire!
  str_bark_poisondot_1: I...feel...faint
  str_bark_poisondot_2: My heart will burst!
  str_bark_poisondot_3: It eats away at my flesh!
  str_bark_poisondot_4: Antivenom!  NOW!
  str_bark_poisondot_5: My skin burns!
  str_bark_pray: Let us all bow our heads in prayer...
  str_bark_preventative_medicine: This injection shall fortify against any internal
    assault on my flesh.
  str_bark_provisions_high_0: Our larder is well-stocked. Whatever dangers we may
    face, starvation is not one of them.
  str_bark_provisions_high_1: Well, at least we won't go hungry.
  str_bark_provisions_high_2: This would be far worse without the great bounty in
    our packs.
  str_bark_provisions_high_3: The rations will carry us. Thank the gods.
  str_bark_provisions_high_4: Whoever packed all this food, I could kiss you.
  str_bark_provisions_low_0: Our provisions run low. This journey best not last much
    longer.
  str_bark_provisions_low_1: Already my stomach aches. We will not survive...
  str_bark_provisions_low_2: So hungry. Why do we not turn back?
  str_bark_provisions_low_3: Hunting here seems futile. All meat is surely tainted.
  str_bark_provisions_low_4: Perhaps we could forage some berries? ... No?
  str_bark_psych_up: Flesh. Blood. Raw hearts and sliced livers!
  str_bark_quarantine: Stay back - all of you.  I'm not well.
  str_bark_reflection: My sword, my trusted ally, unphased by my aspect.
  str_bark_reject_the_gods: I follow only the cult of battle! Trust only what you
    can kill!
  str_bark_release_the_hound: Off with you, girl! See what miscreants await us ahead!
  str_bark_restring_crossbow: A tad taut, my sweet, but I'll look after you...
  str_bark_revel: A jug for each of us! We live once only...time to enjoy it!
  str_bark_sanctuary: Let safety be upon us...let us be veiled in holy Light.
  str_bark_scout_ahead: I will survey our surroundings during the night.
  str_bark_self_medicate: This needle is for me. Finally.
  str_bark_sharpen_spear: "...much better."
  str_bark_stand_tall: Remain vigiliant, my friend!
  str_bark_startmoving_0: Let's not linger.
  str_bark_startmoving_1: Forward!
  str_bark_startmoving_2: Let's find some things to kill.
  str_bark_startmoving_3: Treasure ahead, I'd wager!
  str_bark_startmoving_4: Time to move.
  str_bark_startmoving_5: March, friends!
  str_bark_startmoving_6: We should keep moving.
  str_bark_startmoving_7: Let's go.
  str_bark_stopmoving_0: Hold up!
  str_bark_stopmoving_1: Halt!
  str_bark_stopmoving_2: Wait - let's collect ourselves.
  str_bark_stopmoving_3: Hmmm, where next?
  str_bark_stopmoving_4: Shhh!
  str_bark_strange_powders: I obtained this formula in the far east, and it is wonderous.
  str_bark_stress_abusive: Step to the front, my friends! Be the first to die.
  str_bark_stress_camp_abusive: I'm surrounded by weaklings, and death is the consequence!
  str_bark_stress_camp_depressed: I see only endless dark and our doom.
  str_bark_stress_camp_fearful: I hear something! Monsters in the darkness?
  str_bark_stress_camp_irrational: The sun rises, the river runs, the rooster crows!
  str_bark_stress_camp_masochistic: We find ourselves in an abattoir.
  str_bark_stress_camp_paranoid: What are you three mumbling about - speak up!
  str_bark_stress_camp_selfish: I do everything for this expedition but where is MY
    reward?
  str_bark_stress_depressed: How has it come to this?
  str_bark_stress_fearful: This place will be the end of us all.
  str_bark_stress_irrational: A fine crystal shatters! Pottery cracks!
  str_bark_stress_masochistic: Blood and bone! We are all blood and bone!
  str_bark_stress_paranoid: Watch behind! More could come at any moment!
  str_bark_stress_partyhigh_0: We cringe and shake at every noise!
  str_bark_stress_partyhigh_1: I did not think we'd have it this bad...
  str_bark_stress_partyhigh_2: This is more daunting than I'd expected...
  str_bark_stress_partyhigh_3: What a nightmare this is becoming.
  str_bark_stress_partyhigh_4: I canst even think on our chances...
  str_bark_stress_partylow_0: Our resolve is strong!
  str_bark_stress_partylow_1: This is not so difficult after all.
  str_bark_stress_partylow_2: We are doing well. I had little doubt.
  str_bark_stress_partylow_3: The divine smiles on this day, it seems.
  str_bark_stress_partylow_4: This will be the easiest pay I've ever received.
  str_bark_stress_selfhigh_0: My head swims and the horrors mount.
  str_bark_stress_selfhigh_1: The rigors of this journey...are nearly too much for
    me.
  str_bark_stress_selfhigh_2: I don't think I can take much more...
  str_bark_stress_selfhigh_3: I am not myself... Please, forgive me.
  str_bark_stress_selfhigh_4: You must forgive me... this place -- it is getting to
    me.
  str_bark_stress_selfish: I wasn't meant to die here!
  str_bark_stress_selflow_0: I've seen nothing I am not prepared for.
  str_bark_stress_selflow_1: Things are going according to plan.
  str_bark_stress_selflow_2: I am coping well, despite the madness all around.
  str_bark_stress_selflow_3: This place is horrific... E'en so, I am  at ease.
  str_bark_stress_selflow_4: It looks bad, but there is nothing to fear here.
  str_bark_stressdot_0: The whispers...
  str_bark_stressdot_1: What am I doing here?
  str_bark_stressdot_2: They can sense my weakness!
  str_bark_stressdot_3: My hand shakes.
  str_bark_stressdot_4: The floor seems to pitch and buckle!
  str_bark_stressdot_5: I must master my fear!
  str_bark_stressdot_6: Overwhelming terror!
  str_bark_supply: Being prepared is often about knowing where to look.
  str_bark_tactics: The key to a continued heartbeat is to MOVE YOUR FEET.
  str_bark_the_quickening: I can feel it!
  str_bark_therapy_dog: An affectionate nuzzle should put your hearts right.
  str_bark_tigers_eye: Lose not your grip on the dreams of the past, you must fight
    just to keep them alive!
  str_bark_torch0_0: We can use this blackness against them. Strike before they see
    it.
  str_bark_torch0_1: Are there any torches left?
  str_bark_torch0_2: Now our enemy's back is up against it. We must remain steadfast.
  str_bark_torch_0_0: These beasts will fight harder in the dark.
  str_bark_torch_0_1: We must keep our courage up despite this bleakness.
  str_bark_torch_0_2: Dim, dark, bright, or day... our task is the same.
  str_bark_torch_0_3: Shall we skulk in the dark like monsters ourselves?
  str_bark_torch_0_4: All this darkness, perfect for an ambush...
  str_bark_torch_1_0: Watch your feet in this murk.
  str_bark_torch_1_1: Hrm, hard to see.
  str_bark_torch_1_2: Careful now.
  str_bark_torch_1_3: Watch your step.
  str_bark_torch_1_4: It's easier if you squint...
  str_bark_torch_2_0: This infernal blackness…I can't see my own feet!
  str_bark_torch_2_1: Dark is their ally!
  str_bark_tracking: There is no trail I cannot follow.
  str_bark_triage: Shut your traps and let me tend to those wounds.
  str_bark_trinket_scrounge: I've developed an eye for spotting useful relics.
  str_bark_turn_back_time: Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside... Words are
    like weapons, they wound sometimes.
  str_bark_uncatchable: Naught but my own blade will find the heart of these monstrosities!
  str_bark_unshakeable_leader: My friends, we can pass any test. Do not despair!
  str_bark_weapons_practice: A lifetime of practice still leaves more to learn.
  str_bark_zealous_speech: Forget not that our errand is holy and just! Light will
    prevail!
  str_bark_zealous_vigil: Light, grant me the strength to overcome whatever appears
    in our path.
  str_beast_bark_0: GRAAAGGHHH!
  str_beast_bark_1: Snrrff.
  str_beast_bark_10: AARRARRRGGGH!
  str_beast_bark_11: SKREEEEE!
  str_beast_bark_2: HWRAWRRRRR!
  str_beast_bark_3: ERRRRAAAAAGHHH!
  str_beast_bark_4: GWERRRRRRGGHHH!
  str_beast_bark_5: SHKA-TULURRGHH!
  str_beast_bark_6: Rrrolf.
  str_beast_bark_7: IA! IARRRGH!!!
  str_beast_bark_8: FRRAAAGGNNNN!
  str_beast_bark_9: EEEEERRROARRRGGH!
  str_block_buff_irrational: Aid is but a shadow of control. Don't touch me!
  str_block_buff_masochistic: I don't need your assistance - I want to hurt!
  str_block_camping_meal_depressed: I'm not hungry.
  str_block_camping_meal_irrational: No food for me! I'm already as large as a castle!
  str_block_camping_meal_masochistic: I'd rather feel my body feed on itself. I will
    go without.
  str_block_camping_meal_paranoid: Surely this food is laced with poison! I will have
    none of it.
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_abusive: It pleases me to see the rest suffer.
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_depressed: It's useless. I'm useless.
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_fearful: I can't concentrate. Surely we will be
    set upon at any moment!
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_irrational: The fire...the sparks...enchanting,
    distracting.
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_masochistic: We will all perform better if we
    endure more discomfort.
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_paranoid: There are none here I can trust! They
    wait for me to close my eyes!
  str_block_camping_skill_performer_selfish: Unless it helps myself, why bother?
  str_block_camping_skill_target_abusive: You worthless child! Your talents are weak
    and bankrupt!
  str_block_camping_skill_target_depressed: Waste not your energies on me. I am fallen.
  str_block_camping_skill_target_fearful: INVALID
  str_block_camping_skill_target_irrational: Why should I trust you? I don't trust
    the sun or the moon!
  str_block_camping_skill_target_masochistic: You will not take my pain away!
  str_block_camping_skill_target_paranoid: Don't touch me! You aim only to weaken!
  str_block_combat_retreat_depressed: I cannot face another failure...
  str_block_combat_retreat_irrational: To the end of all things, my friends! Do not
    despair!
  str_block_combat_retreat_masochistic: We stay until all are lost.
  str_block_combat_retreat_paranoid: No! You are trying to trick me!
  str_block_effect_vigorous: I will not join your doom!
  str_block_heal_depressed: Don't delay the inevitable.
  str_block_heal_irrational: With one hand the honey, the other the whip!
  str_block_heal_masochistic: I don't want the pain dulled.
  str_block_heal_paranoid: Don't touch me, you're up to something!
  str_block_item: No, Not for me.
  str_block_item_depressed: Why delay the inevitable...
  str_block_item_irrational: A hoo hee haaha!
  str_block_item_masochistic: I WANT TO FEEL THE PAIN.
  str_block_item_paranoid: I DON'T TRUST YOU.
  str_block_move: I shan't extend myself!
  str_block_move_abusive: Stop fumbling about, you clumsy oaf!
  str_block_move_irrational: I don't feel like dancing, thank you.
  str_block_move_masochistic: Don't interfere with my pain
  str_block_move_paranoid: You will not expose me!
  str_brothel_committed_0: This may sound like a strange request at first, but...
  str_brothel_committed_1: Fetch more pillows!
  str_brothel_committed_2: Here's an extra coin. I wasn't here.
  str_brothel_committed_3: I choose you, you, AND you.  It's been a rough day.
  str_brothel_committed_4: A hot bath and a companion to make it warmer, please.
  str_brothel_committed_5: Shall we settle on a safe word?
  str_brothel_committed_6: Just hold me...for now.
  str_buff_party_powerful: We shall prevail!
  str_buff_random_party_member_focused: Concentrate!
  str_cant_use_torch_at_limit: It's no use...this is all the light we are getting
    for now.
  str_caretaker_bar_0: Powerful spirits will wash the taste of maggots out of my mouth.
  str_caretaker_bar_1: Your face and the drinks are all blending together, my liege!

  str_roster_list_darkest_dungeon_survivor_bark_7: I paint all I see with the horrors
    burned into these eyes.
  str_roster_list_darkest_dungeon_survivor_bark_8: We must seal the gates! Or we are
    doomed! Doomed I say!
  str_roster_list_darkest_dungeon_survivor_bark_9: A blade can be sharpened. Armor
    mended. The soul is forever shattered.
  str_roster_list_depressed_bark_0: Why did I come to this hellish place...

  str_roster_list_flagellation_bark_1: I live upon the razor's edge!
  str_roster_list_flagellation_bark_2: THIS is for loss. THIS is for sin. THIS is
    for victory.
  str_roster_list_flagellation_bark_3: The pain lets me see clearly!
  str_roster_list_gambling_bark_0: Roll those dice again. This one is mine!
  str_roster_list_gambling_bark_1: I'm all in!  What a rush!

  str_roster_list_high_stress_bark_7: The horrors I've seen. I do not know if I can
    handle any more.
  str_roster_list_high_stress_bark_8: I need to do something to take my mind off of
    this.
  str_roster_list_high_stress_bark_9: Drink, god, or dice. I care not what as long
    as it distracts me.
  str_roster_list_irrational_bark_0: Ha ha ha! Hee hee!
  str_roster_list_irrational_bark_1: It writhes, it flips, but yet it says nothing!

  str_roster_list_low_stress_bark_8: I yearn for adventure!
  str_roster_list_low_stress_bark_9: I am restless.
  str_roster_list_masochistic_bark_0: Send me back down! I RELISH THE PAIN!
  str_roster_list_masochistic_bark_1: Give me more scars. Test me again.
  str_roster_list_masochistic_bark_2: Spend no gold on my armor - I wish to bleed!
  str_roster_list_meditation_bark_0: Emptiness is the only defense against an assault
    on the mind.
  str_roster_list_meditation_bark_1: In through the nose, out through the mouth...
  str_roster_list_meditation_bark_2: Nothing within, nothing without...
  str_roster_list_meditation_bark_3: Flow and tranquility...
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_0: Could use some time off.
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_1: I'm fine, quit asking.
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_2: A-alright, I can do one more run.
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_3: Almost didn't make it last time...
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_4: If I must return, I am ready.
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_5: A break would be welcome, but I can go forth
    again if I am needed.
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_6: I cannot take too many more like the last
    journey.
  str_roster_list_medium_stress_bark_7: I knew this would not be easy.
  str_roster_list_paranoid_bark_0: The beasts have followed us back to town! Look!
    The shadow!
  str_roster_list_paranoid_bark_1: The others plot to kill me!
  str_roster_list_paranoid_bark_2: Do NOT cast your gaze upon me! I know your foul
    intent!
  str_roster_list_prayer_bark_0: Grant me the strength and peace of the Light.
  str_roster_list_prayer_bark_1: I submit myself to the highest power.
  str_roster_list_prayer_bark_2: Bless me, though I may be unworthy.
  str_roster_list_prayer_bark_3: The Light shows me how to defeat my enemies!
  str_roster_list_selfish_bark_0: Some of that gold should be coming back to me, for
    my efforts!
  str_roster_list_selfish_bark_1: Forge me new weapons and armor - I alone am worth
    the expense!
  str_roster_list_selfish_bark_2: I sacrifice and sacrifice, and where are my thanks?
  str_roster_list_treatment_bark_0: The room...it spins!
  str_roster_list_treatment_bark_1: I know, I know. This is for mine own good.
  str_roster_list_treatment_bark_2: More blankets!  N-no - fewer blankets!
  str_roster_list_treatment_bark_3: Unlock this door!  I am cured - or am I?!
  str_stagecoach_idle_0: I can handle any foe. I'm sure of it!
  str_stagecoach_idle_1: This could be the chance I've always deserved!
  str_stagecoach_idle_10: Let's do this.
  str_stagecoach_idle_11: This place - so strange, like a dream.  Or a nightmare.
  str_stagecoach_idle_12: If they bleed, we can kill them.
  str_stagecoach_idle_13: I am undaunted by this oppressive atmosphere!
  str_stagecoach_idle_14: Let's get started!
  str_stagecoach_idle_15: I'm ready for anything.
  str_stagecoach_idle_2: I thought I saw something in the woods on the way here...
  str_stagecoach_idle_3: Well, this place is...underwhelming.
  str_stagecoach_idle_4: I'm ready to go!
  str_stagecoach_idle_5: Gold and glory await? Count me in.
  str_stagecoach_idle_6: I'm here for adventure. When does it start?
  str_stagecoach_idle_7: When you say "dangerous", how dangerous do you mean?
  str_stagecoach_idle_8: That road was rough and dark. Surely the worst is behind
    us.
  str_stagecoach_idle_9: The journey here was ...unnerving.
  str_stagecoach_prisoner_rescued: Rescued!
  str_statue_ancestor_quote: In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings...

  str_stress_heal_self_stalwart: Ha! I merely grow stronger!
  str_treatment_committed_0: Wait, what's in that syringe?
  str_treatment_committed_1: Restrain me not!  I am here of my own volition!
  str_treatment_committed_2: Is that device entirely necessary?
  str_treatment_committed_3: Why the leather straps?
  str_treatment_committed_4: I want to be a better person.
  str_treatment_committed_5: S-shackles, really?
  str_treatment_committed_6: Do what you must.  I submit.
  str_unquiet_mind_meditation_rejection_0: What good will sitting alone in a room

  str_vo_bad_afflicted_02_0: Wherefore, heroism?
  str_vo_bad_afflicted_03_0: The mind cannot hope to withstand such an assult.
  str_vo_bad_afflicted_04_0: Even the aged oak will fall to the tempest's winds.
  str_vo_bad_afflicted_05_0: Madness, our old friend!
  str_vo_bad_afflicted_06_0: One can sometimes find clarity in madness, but only rarely...
  str_vo_bad_afflicted_07_0: |-
    Madness - sublimity of the intelligence,

    Frustration and fury, more destructive

     pews, spouting his mindless drivel!
  str_vo_bad_darkest_boss_01_0: |-
    You still foolishly consider yourself an entity separate
     from the whole. I know better, and I. Will. Show you.
  str_vo_bad_darkest_boss_02_0: The flesh is fluid – it can be changed, reshaped,
    remade!
  str_vo_bad_darkest_boss_03_0: |-
    The flesh is immortal, it is undying! Pray
     it does not take too hideous a form...

  str_vo_bad_death_01_0: Survival is a tenuous proposition in this sprawling tomb.
  str_vo_bad_death_02_0: More blood soaks the soil, feeding the evil therein.
  str_vo_bad_death_03_0: Another life wasted in the pursuit of glory and gold.

  str_vo_bad_deaths_door_01_0: Perched at the very precipice of oblivion...
  str_vo_bad_deaths_door_02_0: A hands-breadth from becoming unwound...
  str_vo_bad_deaths_door_03_0: Teetering on the brink, facing the abyss!
  str_vo_bad_deaths_door_04_0: And now the true test...hold fast, or expire?

  str_vo_bad_general_crit_hero_08_0: A dizzying blow to body and brain!
  str_vo_bad_general_crit_hero_09_0: Unnerved, unbalanced
  str_vo_bad_general_crit_hero_10_0: "- exposed to a killing blow..."
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_01_0: A setback, but not the end of things.
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_02_0: Wounds to be tended; lessons to be learned.
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_03_0: Regroup. Reassemble. Evil is timeless, after
    all.
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_04_0: Failure tests the mettle of heart, brain, and
    body.
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_05_0: You will endure this loss, and learn from it.
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_06_0: We fall so that we may learn to pick ourselves
    up once again.
  str_vo_bad_general_quest_fail_07_0: |-
    Do not ruminate on this fleeting failure - the
     campaign is long, and victory will come.

    Ignorance of your enemy and of yourself

    Injury and despondence set the stage

    Without tools of iron, you must rely
     on flesh and indefatiguable purpose.

  str_vo_bad_obstacle_crypts_0: Even the cold stone seems bent on preventing passage.
  str_vo_bad_obstacle_warrens_0: |-
    Such blockages are unsurprising - these tunnels
     predate even the earliest settlers.
  str_vo_bad_obstacle_weald_0: |-
    Nature herself, a victim to the spreading
     corruption, malformed with misintent.
  str_vo_bad_retreat_fail_01_0: True desperation is known only when escape is impossible.
  str_vo_bad_retreat_fail_02_0: Cornered! Trapped! And forced to fight on...
  str_vo_bad_retreat_fail_03_0: No chance for egress - will this be a massacre?
  str_vo_bad_starve_01_0: |-
    Gnawing hunger sets in, turning the body

    At last, in the salt-soaked
     crags beneath the lowest foundations
  str_vo_house_of_ruin_15: |-
    we unearthed that damnable portal

  str_vo_house_of_ruin_16: |-
    Our every step unsettled

    Gazing proudly from its

    I lived all my years in that
     ancient, rumor shadowed manor.
  str_vo_house_of_ruin_5: Fattened by decadence and luxury.
  str_vo_house_of_ruin_6: |-
    And yet, I began to tire
     of conventional extravagance.
  str_vo_house_of_ruin_7: |-
    Singular, unsettling tales
     suggested the mansion itself
  str_vo_house_of_ruin_8: |-
    was a gateway to some
     fabulous and unnamable power.
  str_vo_house_of_ruin_9: With relic and ritual,
  str_vo_load_cove_01_0: |-
    Prying eyes had become a nuisance along the Old Road, and so I undertook
     to receive my most curious deliveries by way of marine shipments.
  str_vo_load_cove_01_1: |-
    A sheltered jetty was accessible by a narrow stone stair off the
     back of the manor, and a discreet system of pulleys could
  str_vo_load_cove_01_2: |-
    hoist even the heaviest prizes up the rock
     face from a securely tied dinghy below.
  str_vo_load_cove_02_0: |-
    I employed a crew of particularly unsavory mariners, who,
     for a time, sailed the four corners at my behest -
  str_vo_load_cove_02_1: |-
    retrieving many valuable artifacts, relics and rare texts. Predictably,
     they increased their tariffs to counter my intense
  str_vo_load_cove_02_2: |-
    stipulations of secrecy. Such resources had long been exhausted,
     of course, and so I prepared an ...alternative payment.
  str_vo_load_cove_03_0: |-
    While the greedy dogs slept off their revelry, I hexed their
     anchor with every twisted incantation I could muster -
  str_vo_load_cove_03_1: |-
    imbuing it with the weight of my ambition,
     and my contempt for their crude extortion.
  str_vo_load_cove_03_2: |-
    At the witching hour, the anchor pulled with preternatural
     force, dragging craft and crew down into the depths.
  str_vo_load_cove_03_3: |-
    They must have cried out, but no sound
     escaped the swirling black waters...
  str_vo_load_cove_04_0: |-
    My lofty position wasn’t always accompanied by the fear of office,
     and there was a time I could walk the streets or raise
  str_vo_load_cove_04_1: |-
    a glass in the tavern without concern for molestation. Faithful
     as the tide, one precocious village waif made it her hobby
  str_vo_load_cove_04_2: |-
    to shadow my every errand. It was
     charming then, troublesome later.
  str_vo_load_cove_05_0: |-
    In financial desperation, I struck a bargain with the ancient things
     that surfaced in search of sacrifice when the moon was right.
  str_vo_load_cove_05_1: |-
    Their price was the delivery of an obscure idol
     and one other item of more troubling portent.
  str_vo_load_cove_05_2: |-
    The pact struck, my newfound accomplices slipped
     silently beneath the brackish water.
  str_vo_load_cove_05_3: |-
    A fearful stirring at the edge of the torchlight betrayed
     a familiar witness, and gifted me with malign inspiration.
  str_vo_load_cove_06_0: |-
    Under the blood moon, I lured my wide-eyed
     prey to the pier’s edge.
  str_vo_load_cove_06_1: |-
    Before she could properly appreciate her position, I clamped
     on a manacle, chaining her to the leering idol.
  str_vo_load_cove_06_2: |-
    A small push was sufficient to send both into the icy waters. And
     when at length the tide receded, jewels of the most magnificent
  str_vo_load_cove_06_3: grandeur lay scattered upon the shore.
  str_vo_load_crypts_01_0: |-
    Mastery over life and death was chief among my early pursuits.
     I began in humility, but my ambition was limitless.
  str_vo_load_crypts_01_1: |-
    Who could have divined the prophetic import of something
     as unremarkable as a twitch in the leg of dead rat?
  str_vo_load_crypts_02_0: |-
    I entertained a delegation of experts from overseas, eager to plumb
     the depths of their knowledge and share with them certain
  str_vo_load_crypts_02_1: |-
    techniques and alchemical processes I had found
     to yield wondrous and terrifying results.
  str_vo_load_crypts_02_2: |-
    Having learned all I could from my visiting
     guests, I murdered them as they slept.
  str_vo_load_crypts_03_0: |-
    I brought my colleagues back with much of their intellect intact,
     a remarkable triumph for even the most experienced necromancer.
  str_vo_load_crypts_03_1: |-
    Freed from the trappings of their humanity, they plied their terrible
     trade anew - the dead reviving the dead, on and on down the years...
  str_vo_load_crypts_03_2: forever.
  str_vo_load_crypts_04_0: |-
    Excavations beneath the Manor were well underway, when
     a particularly ragged indigent arrived in the Hamlet.
  str_vo_load_crypts_04_1: |-
    This filthy, toothless degenerate boasted an uncanny knowledge
     of my ambitions, and prognosticated to all who would listen
  str_vo_load_crypts_04_2: that I would soon unleash doom upon the world.
  str_vo_load_crypts_05_0: |-
    This raving creature had to be silenced, but, to my
     bafflement, doing so proved maddeningly impossible.
  str_vo_load_crypts_05_1: |-
    How had he survived the stockades, the icy waters, and the knives
     I delivered so enthusiastically into his back? How had
  str_vo_load_crypts_05_2: |-
    he returned time and time again to rouse the townsfolk
     with his wild speculations and prophecies?
  str_vo_load_crypts_06_0: |-
    Finally, resigned to his uncommon corporeal
     resilience, I lured him to the dig.
  str_vo_load_crypts_06_1: |-
    There, I showed him the Thing, and detailed
     the full extent of my plans.
  str_vo_load_crypts_06_2: |-
    Triumphantly, I watched as he tore his eyes from their
     sockets, and ran shrieking into the shadows -
  str_vo_load_crypts_06_3: wailing maniacally that the end was upon us all.
  str_vo_load_warrens_01_0: |-
    The ways and rituals of blood sacrifice
     are difficult to master.
  str_vo_load_warrens_01_1: |-
    Those from beyond require a physical vessel if they are to make the
     crossing into our reality. The timing of the chants is imperative -
  str_vo_load_warrens_01_2: |-
    without the proper utterances at precise intervals,
     the process can fail spectacularly.
  str_vo_load_warrens_02_0: |-
    My first attempts at summoning were crude
     and the results, disappointing.
  str_vo_load_warrens_02_1: |-
    I soon found however, that the type and condition
     of the host's meat was a critical factor.
  str_vo_load_warrens_02_2: |-
    The best results came from pigs, whose
     flesh is most like that of man.
  str_vo_load_warrens_03_0: |-
    The Great Thing I had managed to bring
     through was brutish and stupid.
  str_vo_load_warrens_03_1: |-
    Moreover, it required prodigious amounts of meat to sustain itself,
     but this was only a trifling concern – after all, I
  str_vo_load_warrens_03_2: had a village full of it.
  str_vo_load_warrens_04_0: |-
    My zeal for blood rituals and summoning rites had begun to ebb as
     each attempt invariably brought only failure, and disappointment.
  str_vo_load_warrens_04_1: |-
    Progress was halting, and the rapidly accumulating
     surplus of wasted flesh had become...burdensome.
  str_vo_load_warrens_05_0: |-
    I could not store such a prodigious amount of offal, nor could
     I rid myself of it easily, possessed as was by unnameable

    things from outer spheres. When excavations beneath the Manor broke
     through into an ancient network of aqueducts and tunnels,
  str_vo_load_warrens_05_2: I knew I had found a solution to the problem of disposal.
  str_vo_load_warrens_06_0: |-
    The spasmodically squirming, braying, and snorting half-corpses
     were heaped each upon the other until at last I was rid of them.
  str_vo_load_warrens_06_1: |-
    The Warrens became a landfill of snout and hoof, gristle and bone
     – a mountainous, twitching mass of misshapen carcasses
  str_vo_load_warrens_06_2: fusing themselves together in the darkness.

    I had collected many rare and elusive volumes on ancient herbal properties,
     and was set to enjoy several weeks immersed in comfortable study.
  str_vo_load_weald_01_1: |-
    My work was interrupted, however, by a singularly striking
     young woman who insisted on repeated calls to the house.
  str_vo_load_weald_02_0: |-
    Her knowledge of horticulturalism, and its role in
     various arcane practices impressed me greatly.
  str_vo_load_weald_02_1: |-
    My licentious impulse gave way to a genuine, professional respect,
     and together, we began to plant, harvest, and brew.
  str_vo_load_weald_03_0: |-
    As time wore on, her wild policy of self-experimentation
     grew intolerable.
  str_vo_load_weald_03_1: |-
    She quaffed all manner of strange fungii, herbs and concoctions,
     intent on gaining some insight into the horror we both knew
  str_vo_load_weald_03_2: |-
    to be growing beneath us. The change in her was appalling, and,
     no longer able to stomach it, I sent her to live in the
  str_vo_load_weald_03_3: Weald, where her wildness would be welcomed.
  str_vo_load_weald_04_0: |-
    Simple folk are by their nature loquacious, and
     the denizens of the Hamlet were no exception.
  str_vo_load_weald_04_1: |-
    It was not long before rumors of my morbid genius and
     secretive excavations began to fuel local legend.
  str_vo_load_weald_04_2: |-
    In the face of my increasingly egregious flaunting of public taboos,
     awe turned to ire, and demonstrations were held in the town square.
  str_vo_load_weald_05_0: |-
    The wild whispers of heresy roused
     the rabble to violent action.
  str_vo_load_weald_05_1: |-
    Such was the general air of rebellion that even my generous
     offer of gold to the local constabulary was rebuffed!
  str_vo_load_weald_05_2: |-
    To reassert my rule, I sought out unscrupulous
     men skilled in the application of force. Tight-
  str_vo_load_weald_05_3: |-
    lipped and terrifying, these mercenaries brought
     with them a war machine of terrible implication.
  str_vo_load_weald_06_0: |-
    Eager to end the tiresome domestic distraction, I instructed my
     newly formed militia of hardened bandits, brigands and killers
  str_vo_load_weald_06_1: |-
    to go forth and do their work. Compliance and order were restored,
     and the noisome population of the Hamlet was culled to more ...
  str_vo_load_weald_06_2: manageable numbers.

    Knawing hunger sets in, turning the body

    The flopping, fish-like things abhore the warding

    These salt-soaked caverns are teeming with pelagic
     nightmares- they must be flushed out!
  str_vo_neutral_cove_explore_0: |-
    The smell of rotting fish is almost unbearable,

  str_vo_neutral_cove_gather_0: |-
    Recover these lost shipments of rarities, that we may prevent
     them from falling into even less scrupulous hands...
  str_vo_neutral_cove_kill_0: The poor devils, chained and drowning for eternity...
  str_vo_neutral_cove_kill_alt_0: |-
    I always wondered what became of

  str_vo_neutral_crypts_activate_0: Can the defiled be consecrated? Can the fallen
    find rest?
  str_vo_neutral_crypts_cleanse_0: |-
    The fiends must be driven back, and what better
     place to begin than the seat of our noble line?

    The blood of the fallen flows ever downward along these titan

  str_vo_neutral_darkest_01_loading_0: |-
    Once again, the stars are right, and the Manor
     sits at very the epicenter of cosmic unrest.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_01_loading_1: |-
    Cultists rally to their twisted idols, and great gongs sound
     in anticipation of the coming sacrifices. Far below, life-
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_01_loading_2: |-
    laden shadows pulse to the unrelenting
     rhythm of a beating heart...
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_01_return_0: |-
    You have merely glimpsed the edge of the abyss, but
     it is enough to trigger the cycle of revelation.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_01_return_1: |-
    Now, like me, you will begin to
     see things as they truly are...
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_02_hall_0: |-
    Madness made flesh! It crawls steadily upward from the
     pit, supported by the lattice of cyclopean pillars...
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_02_loading_0: |-
    The thing has no name, for it needs no language. Nevertheless, those
     who would submit to its wordless will thing are rewarded,
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_02_loading_1: |-
    in a fashion. The creature's blessings are as repulsive as they
     are robust. Twisted, half-human monstrosities stalk the flesh-
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_02_loading_2: ridden halls, protecting their gestating god.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_02_return_0: |-
    The maniacal cultists are quelled for a
     time, but there can be no celebration.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_02_return_1: |-
    Your progress is measured only in progressive realization,
     and dawning horror. You are in the shadow of the end.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_03_hall_0: |-
    The Gateless Gate. A maddening aperture
     to realms beyond human understanding...
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_03_loading_0: |-
    The interminable stone halls are but an antechamber! The creature
     is vast beyond measure, and must be battled from within.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_03_loading_1: |-
    Step over the threshold and let the terrible
     truth worm its way into your mind.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_03_return_0: |-
    At last, the twisted heart of the world is
     laid bare – for sword, or supplication.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_04_obstacle_01_0: |-
    Life feeds on life. In your petty pursuit of family redemption,
     you consume those who rally to your cause, and in so doing,

    you strengthen the Thing - accelerating the end!
     This is as it should be...it is why you are here.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_04_obstacle_02_0: |-
    In all my terrible researches, what I sought was a glimpse
     behind the veil – a crumb of cosmic truth.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_04_obstacle_02_1: |-
    I found it here, and in that moment of brain-blasting realization,
     I ceased to be a man, and became a Herald, an Avatar of
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_04_obstacle_02_2: the crawling chaos.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_04_obstacle_03_0: |-
    We are chained here forever, you
     and I, at the end of the world.
  str_vo_neutral_darkest_04_obstacle_03_1: |-
    Free yourself, rouse the Thing, and embrace the ineffable
     cosmic hideousness that lives within us all.

    The Swine draw power from their horrid markings
     and crude idols - tear them down!

  str_vo_neutral_warrens_explore_0: |-
    To prosecute our war against the Swine,

    The fiercest beast will lay down when

  str_vo_neutral_warrens_kill_0: |-
    A nameless abomination, a testament to

  str_vo_neutral_warrens_kill_alt_0: |-
    The thing is more terrible than I can describe -
     an incoherent jumble of organ, sinew and bone.
  str_vo_neutral_weald_activate_0: Excise the fungal tumors and the land may yet live.

    Corruption has soaked the soil, sapping all good life

  str_vo_neutral_weald_explore_0: |-
    I knew all these paths once; now they

  str_vo_neutral_weald_gather_0: |-
    Our land is remote and unneighbored. Every
     lost resource must be recovered.
  str_vo_neutral_weald_kill_0: |-
    There is method in the wild corruption here.
     It bears a form both wretched and malevolent.
  str_vo_neutral_weald_kill_alt_0: |-
    The smell of sulfur and gunpowder hangs
     in the air, the war machine is close.
  str_vo_old_road_0: You will arrive along the old road.
  str_vo_old_road_1: |-
    It winds with a troubling,
     serpent-like suggestion
  str_vo_old_road_10: So steel yourself
  str_vo_old_road_11: and remember there can be no bravery
  str_vo_old_road_12: without madness.
  str_vo_old_road_13: The old road will take you hell
  str_vo_old_road_14: but in that gaping abyss
  str_vo_old_road_15: we will find our redemption.
  str_vo_old_road_2: through the corrupted countryside.
  str_vo_old_road_3: Leading only, I fear
  str_vo_old_road_4: to ever more tenebrous places.
  str_vo_old_road_5: |-
    There is a sickness

  str_vo_old_road_6: of the old road
  str_vo_old_road_7: and on its writhing path
  str_vo_old_road_8: |-
    you will face viciousness,
     violence, and perhaps
  str_vo_old_road_9: other damnably transcendent terrors.
  str_vo_town_backstory_01_0: Once, our Estate was the envy of this land.
  str_vo_town_backstory_02_0: |-
    I remember days when the sun shone, and
     laughter could be heard from the Tavern.
  str_vo_town_backstory_03_0: |-
    I was lord of this place, before the

  str_vo_town_backstory_04_0: |-
    I see something long-absent in the sunken

    The poor Cartetaker, I fear his longstanding

    The degeneracy of the Hamlet is nothing, I fear, when

    Our family name, once so well regarded, is

    We dug for months, years - an eternity.

    The plume and the pistol - a fitting end

    All the decadent horrors I have seen pale in comparison

    Can you feel it? The walls between the sane world and that
     unplumbed dimension of delirium are tenously thin here...
  str_vo_town_backstory_21_0: |-
    All my life, I could feel an insistent
     gnawing in the back of my mind.
  str_vo_town_backstory_21_1: |-
    It was a yearning, a thirst for discovery

  str_vo_town_backstory_22_0: |-
    An eternity of futile struggle - a penance

    The task ahead is terrible, and

    gold.
  town_event_description_bonus_recruit_crusader: "...inexplicably however, only two
    have arrived. It appears that the Abbot's earnest appeal has been answered, albeit
    with mocking cruelty."
  town_event_description_bonus_recruit_hellion: Debaucherous and decadent in the extreme,
    several nomadic warriors have wandered into the Hamlet in search of a glorious
    death. We can only hope they find it quickly.
  town_event_description_bonus_recruit_leper: One cannot help but admire these unfortunate
    souls - they bear their burden with a grace and humility seldom seen in the able-bodied.
  town_event_description_bonus_recruit_occultist: While strange utterances and unsettling
    chants typically characterize such events, we have been assured there is no real
    danger present in the rituals themselves.

    even death may be defied in this damnable place. Only ONE of these soldiers can
    be returned to the living...

    seem to be on the wind. Many adventurers confess to having a troubled disposition,

    expressed relief at the abatement of the nauseating odour emanating from the ancient
    aqueducts.

    spotted in the surrounding wood - a rarity in these parts.
  town_event_description_free_abbey: The Abbey will be decorated for the duration
    of the event, and all are welcome to visit during the extended hours.
  town_event_description_free_all_activities: The town is alight with a spirit of
    goodwill and revelry, but this life-affirming attitude is not predicted to last
    long.
  town_event_description_free_disease: The time and gold were not spent in vain, however,
    as today caregivers announced they have succeeded in concocting an effective antidote.
  town_event_description_free_sanitarium: Among the visiting delegation are experts
    in corporeal and cognitive disability, as well as several forensic specialists.
  town_event_description_free_tavern: The Tavern will be open later than normal throughout
    the celebration, and residents are asked to maintain some semblance of decorum
    when leaving after midnight.
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_abomination: "...and it is during such
    lunar phases that many residents report shrieks and howls of the most profoundly
    unnerving quality."
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_arbalest: The keenest eye and steadiest
    hand will prevail during this week's tournament. The winner will claim the coveted
    Caretaker's Cup.
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_grave_robber: Most curious of all, however,
    is the absence of any evidence in the crypt itself. Nevertheless, the chest was
    found open, its contents conspicuously missing.
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_highwayman: In the ensuing melee, two
    of the men escaped the scene and are said to be at large. They are most assuredly
    armed, dangerous, and desperate.
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_houndmaster: Threats to our collective
    safety are never in short supply, but this week our local constabulary received
    a welcome augmentation...
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_jester: The music itself is damnably familiar,
    and yet, strangely unplaceable. Is it the instrument's odd tuning, or some inhuman
    quality in the bard's fingers?
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_man_at_arms: The veteran Sergeant will
    be demonstrating his training regimen at the Guild Hall every night for the next
    week. All those concerned with self-preservation are encouraged to attend.
  town_event_description_idle_resolve_level_plague_doctor: The shadow of sickness
    and disease has cast itself upon our Hamlet, and with it - panic.
  town_event_description_idle_stress_heal_buff: "...and while the campaign continues
    to drag on, recent events have emboldened the standing roster. Confidence is reported
    to be at an all-time high."
  town_event_description_in_activity_buff_stress_heal_buff: This pleasant weather
    comes as a welcome change, particularly for those currently enjoying a period
    of convalescence.
  town_event_description_in_activity_buff_stress_heal_debuff: '...as one man put it,
    Somethin'' ain''t right with them shadows - movin'' and twistin'' as they do.".
    Residents are advised to stay indoors until daybreak."'
  town_event_description_lock_bar_discount_tavern: Ironically, those most vocal concerning
    the current dearth of spirits and mead are the same patrons whose unrestrained
    exuberance the night before exhausted the supply.
  town_event_description_lock_brothel_discount_tavern: Bedsheets and pillowcases gleam
    white on the line, their lascivious history easily erased, unlike the consciences
    of those who sullied them.
  town_event_description_lock_flagellation_discount_abbey: The Abbot will not comment
    on the condition of the Penance Hall at this time, except to say that he expects
    normal operations to be resumed shortly.
  town_event_description_lock_gambling_discount_tavern: Operations will be suspended
    temporarily, but given the limited avenues of egress from the Hamlet, officials
    are optimistic the thieves will be apprehended shortly.
  town_event_description_lock_meditation_discount_abbey: Indeed, the elements have
    not been kind to the old Abbey; the very soil itself seems to reject the place.
    Work is expected to last through the week.
  town_event_description_lock_prayer_discount_abbey: The Abbot has sequestered himself
    in the wine cellar, ostensibly to consider how best to help his parisioners cope
    with the deluge of godless horrors that plague these lands.
  town_event_description_nomad_wagon_trinket_discount: The collection is indeed impressive,
    and all the more appealing when one takes notice of the discounted prices.
  town_event_description_plot_quest_crow_trinket: Stunned by the apparent value of
    the thing concealed amidst its putrid feathers, onlookers wondered if a trek to
    its perch might not be in order...
  town_event_description_plot_quest_town_invasion_0: To arms! A Brigand raiding party
    is descending upon the Hamlet with explosive fury and murderous intent!

    off the coast, and the surviving crew have proven distressingly evasive concerning
    the particulars of this latest nautical nightmare.

    crowd, the Caretaker credits a thick fog and an early departure time for the wagon's
    safe arrival.

    increasing security in an effort to protect the healthy livestock and crops upon
    which the Hamlet depends.

    not come easily to such seasoned survivors, but the new recruits are palpably
    grateful for the assistance.
  town_event_description_trinket_retention_add_from_storage: In the end, however,
    the damnable thing managed to get away with its prize; the Hamlet's coffers all
    the poorer for having hosted the unwanted guest.
  town_event_description_upgrade_tag_free_armour: He stayed up working for days, inspired
    by the rare quality of his materials, and determined to do them justice with his
    own skill.
  town_event_description_upgrade_tag_free_building_upgrade: Historically, seasonal
    labourers have been loath to make the journey along the Old Road, but harsh economic
    conditions have driven them to desperation.
  town_event_description_upgrade_tag_free_weapon: In the end, the hours of rooting
    through the old barrels and forgotten weapon racks bore fruit!

    in strength and numbers. Cut them like diseased wheat.

    formations beneath the Manor for signs of life.

    but don't delve too far.
  town_quest_description_explore+1+warrens+explore_all_rooms: The beast-men spill
    forth from a thousand gaping holes. Pick one and search its extents.
  town_quest_description_explore+1+weald+explore_all_rooms: Take the Old Road into
    the wood and then pick any of the dozens of dark paths. Test that path and then

    and assess the cancerous extent of the fishfolk's domain.

    a complete map.
  town_quest_description_explore+3+weald+explore_all_rooms: The Weald was nearly inscrutable
    even before the corruption. Now it is nothing but dark mystery. Provision well
    and mount an expedition to map as much ground as you can.

    eldritch relics via marine shipments. Find and return them to town where they
    can be stored safely out of the hands of greater evils.
  town_quest_description_gather+2+crypts+gather_holy_relic: When the Estate was overrun,
    so too were many treasures and symbols of the Light. The Abbot will pay dearly
    for such relics.
  town_quest_description_gather+2+warrens+gather_grain: The swine's appetite for comestibles
    exceeds even their thirst for blood. Winter is always close, and the Hamlet would
    do well to restock its sparse larder.
  town_quest_description_gather+2+weald+gather_medicines: Many a cart-driver has met
    their end while traversing the Weald. A king's ransom of medicines was recently

    corpses lay strewn about the Old Road, teeming with filth and disease. Journeys

    stopped.

    world is laid bare – for sword, or supplication.

    this ironwork devil!

    drag all we've built down into their domain of darkness. Give them a sailor's
    death - once and for all!

    to live. Cleanse the sin of the Ancestor's experimentations and put this abomination
    into the abyss where it belongs.

    the spoor of a vile cannibalistic hag. For all that is good, destroy her.
  town_quest_description_plot_kill_necromancer_1: A Necromancer is performing unspeakable
    rituals in the shattered halls of your ancestral home… it must be stopped.
  town_quest_description_plot_kill_prophet_1: Raving madman, doom bearer, apocalyptic
    herald. Whatever his role, there is a sickness in his wild sermons that must be

    it.

    descending upon the Hamlet with explosive fury, and murderous intent!
